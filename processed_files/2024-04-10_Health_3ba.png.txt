Immigration: Appeals
Darren Jones: [19426]
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, how many allowed appeals from
(a) First and (b) Upper Tribunal are awaiting implementation; and what the average time
taken to implement allowed appeal decisions was in each year between 2019 and 2023.
Tom Pursglove:
The requested information cannot be accurately extracted from our internal systems.
To provide this information would require a manual trawl of successful appeals and to
do so would incur disproportionate cost.

Where an appeal has been allowed in favour of the appellant, and is not subject to
â€˜onward appeal, we take all reasonable steps to implement the allowed appeal in a
timely manner.
