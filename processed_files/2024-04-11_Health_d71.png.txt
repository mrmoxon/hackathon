providers should consider as part oftheir case-by-case assessment of an individual's
‘heeds in room sharing, including whether they identify as LGBT. This aligns with the
allocation of accommodation policy which sets out that the circumstances of every
‘person in asylum accommodation should be assessed individually, Where an
Individual need or safeguarding concern exists, accommodation may be provided to
‘meet such need.

‘Additionally the Home Office has published the Asylum Support Contracts
‘Safeguarding Framework at: hitps /iwww.gov ukigovernment/publications/asylum=

‘overarching approach, as well asthe key controls and reporting mechanisms in

provided forthe Home Office by Migrant Help where they can raise any concerns
‘egarding accommodation or support services and they can get information about
how to obtain futher support.
