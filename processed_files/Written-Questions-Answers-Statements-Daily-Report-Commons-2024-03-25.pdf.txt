ANSWERS 

  BUSINESS AND TRADE 

  Horizon IT System: Compensation 

Rebecca Long Bailey:        

 [19079] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, if she will publish the evidential 
basis on which the value of the fixed sum award for the Horizon Shortfall Scheme 
claimants was set at Â£75,000. 

Rebecca Long Bailey:        

 [19080] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, if she will publish the evidential 
basis on which the value of the fixed and final offer for Horizon Convictions Redress 
Scheme claimants was set at Â£600,000. 

Kevin Hollinrake: 
The Government is regularly publishing data on the redress paid out across the 
Horizon work-streams. The fixed sum awards for the Group Litigation Order (GLO) 
scheme and for overturned convictions have been set at a level that is likely to be 
generous for a significant proportion of claims, allowing them to be resolved promptly. 
However, it will not suit everyone and anyone who wishes to pursue the full claims 
process is able to do so. 

The Horizon Shortfall Scheme fixed sum is set at the same level as the GLO to 
ensure consistency between the two schemes. 

INEOS: Belgium 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19719] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, pursuant to the Answer of 13 
March 2024 to Question 17476 on INEOS: Belgium, what exports that funding will 
support. 

Greg Hands: 
UK Export Finance (UKEF) does not provide direct funding. It issued a guarantee to 
commercial lenders to help secure new export opportunities for the UK. 

UKEFâs support is conditional on the inclusion of UK goods and services in the 
project and therefore secures export opportunities that might not otherwise have 
happened, both from businesses directly contracted by INEOS, and others in their 
supply chains. 

  Living Wage 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [18959] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, whether she (a) is taking and (b) 
plans to take steps to encourage businesses to pay the real living wage. 

 
Kevin Hollinrake: 
The National Living Wage (NLW) will increase to Â£11.44 on 1 April and be extended 
to workers over 21. It is reaching two-thirds of median earnings, meeting our 
commitment to end low hourly pay for those eligible. 

The Government commends employers who are able to go beyond the legal 
minimum. However, the ability to do so varies across sector and region. 

Unlike other voluntary rates of pay, the statutory NLW is based on the advice of the 
Low Pay Commission, which takes into account the impact on business and the wider 
economy, as well as the living standards of workers. 

  Post Offices: Closures 

Naz Shah:        

 [18890] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, what steps he is taking to prevent 
the closure of local post offices. 

Kevin Hollinrake: 
Government is committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Post Office 
network and has provided over Â£2.5 billion in funding to support the Post Office 
network over the past decade and is providing a further Â£628 million for the Post 
Office between 2022 and 2025. 

The Post Office network is not in decline. As CEO Nick Read confirmed recently, the 
network is as large as it has been for about five years with around 11,700 branches. 
Government continues to monitor Post Office's network numbers and performance, 
and Post Office publishes an annual network report. 

  CABINET OFFICE 

  Unpaid Work: Equality and Social Mobility 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18768] 

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, whether he has made a recent assessment of 
the potential impact of unpaid internships on (a) social mobility and (b) equality of 
opportunity. 

John Glen: 
The Cabinet Office is only responsible for the Civil Service Summer Internship 
Programmes and the Autism Exchange Internship Programme. It does not oversee 
any unpaid internships. Both programmes pay the National Living Wage. Internships 
provide a fantastic opportunity for individuals at the beginning of their career to gain 
valuable experience in their field regardless of background. Last year, we offered 
over 500 internships to undergraduates through our Fast Stream Summer Internship 
Programme and 21.5% of these were to students from Lower Socio-Economic 
backgrounds. 

  CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT 

  Arts 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18927] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what steps her Department is 
taking with creative industry leaders to help ensure (a) growth and (b) sustainability in 
that sector. 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18928] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, if she will take steps to 
publish a strategy for the arts and creative industries. 

Julia Lopez: 
The UK Government has a clear plan to grow the creative industries by a further Â£50 
billion and support another 1 million jobs by 2030. As set out in the Creative 
Industries Sector Vision, we are committed to working with industry and the devolved 
administrations to ensure our creative industries continue to be the best in the world. 
The Sector Vision sets out our 2030 goals and objectives for supporting the creative 
industries. 

As part of the Growth goal, we outline how we are supporting creative businesses to 
grow and scale-up through investment, innovation and export support - including 
through programmes like the Create Growth Programme and the Creative Clusters. 

As part of the Maximising Impact goal, we set out an objective specifically for the 
environment: âCreative industries play a growing role in tackling environmental 
challenges, helping the UK reach the targets set out in the Powering Up Britain planâ. 
As part of this, the Creative Industries Council, which represents industry and worked 
with government to develop the Sector Vision, have published their Creative Climate 
Charter, which sets out key environmental principles for creative companies to aspire 
to. We will continue to work with industry and across government to address this 
objective. 

  Arts: Competition 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18764] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, whether her Department has 
a long-term strategy to support the (a) expansion and (b) global competitiveness of 
creative industries. 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18766] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what steps her Department is 
taking to help (a) support and (b) increase (i) creative and (ii) cultural exports. 

Julia Lopez: 
In June 2023, the Government and the Creative Industries Council launched the 
Creative Industries Sector Vision, which sets out our long term strategy for supporting 

and growing the creative industries. The Sector Vision can be found at the following 
link: 

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creative-industries-sector-vision 

The Government is delivering on its plan to grow the creative industries by a further 
Â£50 billion and add another 1 million jobs by 2030. 

Since 2010, the Government has introduced a range of tax reliefs across the creative 
industries, from film and television, to animation, video games, orchestras, theatres 
and more. The Chancellor announced further support at the Spring Budget, with Â£1 
billion of additional tax relief over the next five years. This has led to significant 
growth in the creative industries over the last 14 years, helping to double the 
economic value of the creative industries and create more than one million new jobs 
since 2010. 

Our tax reliefs are driving inward investment, helping unleash job creation and 
economic growth across the country. The Governmentâs generous screen sector tax 
reliefs have driven a record breaking spend of Â£6.3 billion on film and high-end TV 
production in 2022, of which Â£5.4 billion - 86% - was inward investment. 

Our tax reliefs have also helped drive an increase in cultural and creative service 
exports. DCMS works with other departments including FCDO and DBT, industry 
bodies and trade associations to promote the creative industries overseas, from 
delivering creative trade missions to HMG-backed funding schemes. Examples 
include the Â£28 million UK Global Screen Fund, delivered by the British Film Institute, 
which provides grants to develop, distribute and promote independent UK and UK co-
produced screen content in international markets and the Music Export Growth 
Scheme, which provides grant funding to support UK-based independent music 
SMEs to develop export campaigns to grow their international business and export 
revenue. My department is also committed to ensuring that the interests of the 
creative industries are pursued in the UKâs ambitious programme of Free Trade 
Agreements, including on audiovisual services, intellectual property rights and 
supporting the movement of creative professionals. 

  ByteDance 

Liam Byrne:        

 [19002] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, whether Bytedance would be 
required to divest ownership of TikTok under the terms of the provision on Foreign power 
acquisition of news media organisations added by the Government to the Digital Markets, 
Competition and Consumers Bill. 

Julia Lopez: 
The new terms introduced in our amendments to the Digital Markets, Competition 
and Consumers Bill (DMCC) are based on the Enterprise Act 2002, and will therefore 
only apply to newspapers and news magazines given the unique role these 
publications play in contributing to the health of our democracy by providing accurate 
news and information, helping to shape opinions and contributing to political debate. 

These changes would not cover online news providers or online intermediaries, 
including social media platforms such as TikTok. 

  Musicians: Immigration Controls 

Barbara Keeley:        

 [19583] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, what information her 
Department holds on the number of (a) musicians and (b) music groups that were 
scheduled to play in the UK that were refused entry due to immigration rules in the last 12 
months. 

Barbara Keeley:        

 [19584] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, on what dates her 
Department's working group on creative and cultural touring has met since June 2022; 
and how many times a Minister has attended those meetings. 

Julia Lopez: 
Border Force does not hold the data requested. 

The UKâs rules for touring creative professionals are comparatively more generous 
than in many EU Member States. The UKâs domestic rules allow musicians, 
entertainers and artists from non-visa national countries, such as EU Member States 
and the US, to perform in the UK without requiring a visa, and the UK does not have 
work permits. 

The Government is committed to supporting the UKâs creative industries, including 
musicians, to adapt to new arrangements with the EU. 

Sector specific guidance on creative professionals from non-visa national countries, 
including the EU and the US, visiting the UK for performance and work has been 
published by DCMS on GOV.UK can be found in the â Visiting the UK as a creative 
professional from a non-visa national country guidance â on GOV.UK. 

DCMS has worked across government and in collaboration with the music and wider 
creative industries to support working and touring with confidence in the EU. Ongoing 
industry engagement continues at ministerial and official level. This includes several 
recent events with the sector focused on touring and export support, hosted in 
partnership with the Department for Business and Trade. These events help to 
provide tailored guidance to stakeholders within the music sector, alongside an 
opportunity for the sector to discuss with Ministers and officials touring challenges 
and opportunities. 

  DEFENCE 

  Armed Forces 

Sarah Jones:        

 [18550] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the Answer of 30 January 2024 to 
Question 10758 on Armed Forces, if he will name the regiments in the (a) Army and (b) 
Royal Marines which have been (i) disbanded and (ii) merged since 2010. 

James Heappey: 
Further to the table provided to you in my letter of 7 February, the British Army 
regiments which have been disbanded since 2010 have been listed below. 

As noted in that letter, this information represents single Service estimates based on 
management information which is not gathered for statistical purposes or subject to 
the same level of scrutiny as official statistics produced by Defence Statistics. I have 
attached an updated table to reflect minor discrepancies in the original which were 
observed during further analysis. 

Within the Royal Armoured Corps, the 1 st and 2 nd Royal Tank Regiments were 
merged to become The Royal Tank Regiment in 2014. The Queenâs Royal Lancers 
merged with the 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Walesâs) to become the Royal 
Lancers in 2015. For the Reserves, the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry 
was placed in suspended animation in 2014. The Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry 
was created in the same year. 

Within the Army Air Corps, 9 th Regiment Army Air Corps was disbanded as a front-
line regiment in 2016 and re-established as a flying regiment in 2018. 

Within the Royal Artillery, 40 th Regiment Royal Artillery was placed into suspended 
animation in 2012 as was 39 th Regiment in 2015. For the Reserves, 100 (Yeomanry) 
Regiment Royal Artillery was placed in suspended animation in 2014. 

The table below has been updated for the Royal Engineers. Within this Corps, 25 
Engineer Regiment was disbanded in 2012 as was 38 Engineer Regiment in 2013. 
28 Engineer Regiment was disbanded in 2014 but re-established in 2018. For the 
Reserves, both 72 and 73 Engineer Regiments disbanded in 2014. There were also 
two hybridised regiments; 101 Engineer Regiment and 33 Engineer Regiment. 101 
Engineer Regiment became a Reserve regiment in 2018 and 33 Engineer Regiment 
became Regular regiment. 

Within the Royal Signals, 7 Signal Regiment disbanded in 2012. 15 Signal Regiment 
was re-formed in 2015 and 13 Signal Regiment in 2020. For the Reserves, 38 Signal 
Regiment disbanded in 2015. 

The table below has been updated for the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers 
(REME). Within this Regiment, 5 Battalion REME was formed in 2013. In 2015, 10 
Battalion REME and 11 Battalion REME merged to become 8 Battalion REME. For 
the Reserves, 104 Battalion REME was disbanded in 2013. This was then re-
established in 2015 along with 105 and 106 Battalions. However, in 2018, 104 

Battalion merged with 103, 105 Battalion merged with 101, and 106 Battalion merged 
with 102. 

The table below has been updated for the Royal Logistic Corps (RLC). Within this 
Corps, 8 Regiment RLC was disbanded in 2012. 12 Logistic Support Regiment was 
disbanded in 2013. 2 Logistic Support Regiment, 23 and 24 Regiment RLC were

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18933] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
impact of trends in the level of his Department's budget on the operational capability of 
the armed forces. 

James Heappey: 
Since 2020 UK defence spending has seen several substantial increases, starting 
with a Â£20 billion cash increase in SR20, additional funding for munitions and wider 
resilience, as well as an additional Â£11 billion as part of the 2023 Spring Statement 

Over the next decade we have increased the budget for our Equipment Plan to 
Â£288.6 billion to ensure that the Armed Forces have the next generation equipment 
they need to defend Britain and maintain a strategic advantage. 

During this time we have continued to meet all operational commitments, including 
participating in every single NATO mission, as well as supporting the Granting in Kind 
of equipment, and training to Ukraine. 

 
 
 
We recognise the world is more uncertain and volatile than it has been for several 
years, and we have set out our longer-term aspiration to invest 2.5% of GDP on 
defence when the fiscal and economic circumstances allow. 

Stephen Crabb:        

 [902184] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps his Department is taking to recruit 
armed forces personnel. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
In a challenging labour market, we continue to apply an array of measures to support 
recruitment and retention and refine the Armed Forcesâ offer including last year with 
the largest pay increase for more than two decades. Haythornthwaite Review teams 
have been stood up across Defence to implement all of Rick Haythornthwaiteâs 67 
recommendations, working to establish a reward and incentivisation architecture that 
will attract and retain the skills we need in the years ahead. 

  Armed Forces and Veterans 

Andrew Selous:        

 [902185] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps he is taking to ensure parity of 
support provided to (a) armed forces families and (b) veterans. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
Much of the policy that impacts Service families and veterans within the UK is not 
owned by Defence. We work with Other Government Departments and the Devolved 
Administrations to ensure that, wherever possible, disadvantage associated with 
Service life is mitigated and effective support is provided; the Armed Forces 
Covenant is an especially important tool in this. 

  Armed Forces: Applications 

John Healey:        

 [19531] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many applications to join the (a) British 
Army, (b) Royal Navy and (c) Royal Air Force have been voluntarily withdrawn within (i) 
three, (ii) six, (iii) 12 and (iv) 18 months of the initial application being made in the last five 
years. 

John Healey:        

 [19532] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many and what proportion of applications 
to join the (a) British Army, (b) Royal Navy and (c) Royal Air Force took more than (i) 
three, (ii) six, (iii) 12 and (iv) 18 months to process before a potential recruit began basic 
training over the last five years. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
It is taking time to collate the required information to answer the right hon. Memberâs 
Questions. I will write to him when the information is available, and a copy of this 
letter will be placed in the Library of The House. 

  Armed Forces: Asbestos 

John Healey:        

 [19534] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what data his Department holds on the 
number of personnel who (a) were exposed to asbestos and (b) sought medical 
assistance as a result of asbestos exposure in the last 12 months. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
Information regarding personnel exposed to asbestos is not held centrally and the 
number of personnel who were exposed to asbestos in the last 12 months could only 
be provided at disproportionate cost. 

Between 1 February 2023 and 31 January 2024, 127 UK Armed Forces personnel 
had at least one read code related to asbestos exposure entered into their electronic 
medical record. Of these personnel: 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, with reference to the report entitled 
Investigation into the alleged exposure of UK Defence Personnel to asbestos during 
overseas exercises and training since 2018, published on 18 August 2022, how many 
Armed Forces personnel have been exposed to asbestos during overseas exercises 
in each year since 2018. 

â¢  114 had at least one read code for history of asbestos exposure. 

â¢  17 had at least one read code for Control of Substances Hazardous to Health: 

asbestos. 

â¢  Fewer than five had at least one read code for asbestosis. 

The figures provided by read code do not sum to the total, as some personnel have 
more than one of the above read codes recorded. 

The presence of a read code within the last year does not indicate that the medical 
appointment was directly related to asbestos exposure. It also does not indicate that 
the asbestos exposure occurred during the last year, or that exposure occurred whist 
in Service. 

  Armed Forces: Housing 

Maria Eagle:        

 [18057] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many complaints his Department has 
received from service personnel and their dependents on service accommodation issues 
each year since 2019. 

James Cartlidge: 
The MOD currently provides circa 47,800 Service Family Accommodation (SFA) 
properties across 500 locations in the UK. 

The table below shows the number of reported complaints relating to both Single 
Living Accommodation (SLA) and SFA:

  Armed Forces: Mental Health Services 

Maria Eagle:        

 [18999] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how many phone calls were made to the 24 
hour Military Mental Health Helpline in each year since 2019. 

Maria Eagle:        

 [19000] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what the annual budget for the Military Mental 
Health Helpline was in each financial year since 2019-20. 

Dr Andrew Murrison:

Maria Eagle:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, how much his Department has spent on 
vehicle support in each financial year since 2019-20. 

James Cartlidge: 
The Vehicle Support (VS) delivery team total equipment and support spend by 
financial year is as follows:

spend of that team. The figures do not represent the total spend on all vehicle 
support across Defence which would not be held centrally and would not be 
answerable without a disproportionate cost. 

  Armed Forces: Workplace Pensions 

Martyn Day:        

 [902183] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what recent assessment he has made of the 
potential implications for his policies of pension inequality among armed forces veterans. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
Pension schemes develop over time in response to changing circumstances, but the 
Armed Forces Pension Schemes are designed to be generous, fair and equitable. It 
is a principle of public service pensions policy, upheld by successive Governments, 
that improvements to public service pension schemes should not be applied 
retrospectively. 

  Defence: Procurement 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18934] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what recent assessment he has made of the 
effectiveness of the defence procurement system. 

James Cartlidge: 
The Department uses a range of measures to assess the effectiveness of defence 
acquisition. We have reduced the average time taken to deliver our projects and 
programmes. But we must go further to drive pace. I therefore announced plans for a 
new Integrated Procurement Model in my oral statement of 28 February 2024 on 
Defence Acquisition Reform. 

A guidance note setting out the key features of the new model was placed in the 
Library and is available at Integrated Procurement Model: driving pace in the delivery 
of military capability - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).

not represent the total spend on all space projects across Defence. 

  Middle East: Humanitarian Aid 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18935] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what steps he is taking with the Secretary of 
State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs to increase the number of aid 
shipments to the Middle East. 

James Heappey: 
Defence works very closely with and to support the FCDO, who lead on humanitarian 
support, to make sure that aid shipments are delivered as rapidly, efficiently and 
safely as possible. We have supported the delivery of hundreds of tonnes of life-
saving aid for Gaza, including by air, land and maritime routes. We are doing 
everything we can to get far more aid in, exploring new routes and pressing Israel to 
open more crossings and lift restrictions. The Secretaries of State regularly engage 
on this matter.

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18932] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
impact of the funding allocated to his Department in the Spring Budget 2024 on (a) 
national security and (b) the UK's commitments to its international allies. 

James Heappey: 
UK defence spending is at its highest level in history and is increasing in real terms. 
We were one of the first countries to support Ukraine following Russiaâs illegal 
invasion The Integrated Review Refresh recognised the implications of the invasion 
on our own security and wellbeing, providing extra investment and strengthening our 
alliances via partnerships (AUKUS and GCAP). 

In a volatile, complex and ambiguous security environment we are a proud leading 
contributor to NATO, contributing to every NATO mission and operation. The UK was 
the first large European country to commit to 2% of GDP for defence and we have 
consistently met or exceeded the NATO target. 

We also remain committed to increasing our overall spending to 2.5% of GDP as 
soon as fiscal and economic conditions allow. The Prime Minister has been clear that 
the target and path towards 2.5% will be set out at the next Spending Review. 

The hon. Member will be concerned to note that his own party has thus far declined 
to match the Governments commitments on defence spending, saying only that a 
Labour Government would meet the 2% NATO minimum. Such a policy would mean 
an immediate Â£7 billion cut to the defence budget, with profound consequences for 
both our national security and our relationship with international allies. 

 
 
  Ministry of Defence: Legal Costs

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what the total cost to the public purse was of 
legal (a) support and (b) representation to Ministers in his Department in relation to their 
official conduct in each of the last three years. 

Dr Andrew Murrison: 
Such information is not centrally recorded or collated in the format requested. More 
generally, I would refer the hon. Member to the long-standing policies on legal 
expenditure, as set out recently by Cabinet Office Ministers on 12 March 2004, 
Official Report,17709 and 12 March 2024, Official Report, House of Lords, column 
1901-1904. 

  Ministry of Defence: Procurement 

Sarah Atherton:        

 [17697] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, whether he is taking steps to ensure that the 
social value model is applied (a) correctly and (b) consistently in his Department's 
procurement processes. 

Sarah Atherton:        

 [17699] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, whether his Department's assessment of 
companies against its social value criteria gives equal weighting to benefits that are 
brought (a) direct to the UK and (b) overseas. 

James Cartlidge: 
The Ministry of Defence (MOD) applies the Social Value Model to all of its in-scope 
competitive procurements, in accordance with the Cabinet Office Social Value Policy. 
The MOD ensures correct and consistent application of the Social Value Model 
through additional policy, guidance, training and through engagement with industry 
through the Defence Supplier Forum. Its application is monitored through appropriate 
governance, reporting and reviews. 

Weightings are applied to the award criteria, and supplier proposals are assessed 
qualitatively not quantitively in tender evaluation. The Social Value Model does not 
discriminate based on where social value is delivered. However where appropriate, 
and having due regard to UK market access obligations to our international fair-trade 
agreements (FTAs), procurements may specify, within their social value requirement, 
the social value to be delivered in specific geographical locations. 

MOD currently applies Cabinet Office Social Value rules, and further, Defence 
specific values. For example, the New Medium Helicopter procurement has a strong 
weighting for UK workshare and exportability. To ensure the maximum impact of the 
Integrated Procurement Model, particular in supporting the development of sovereign 
capability, I will be undertaking a rapid review of how MOD applies social content 
rules on Defence Procurement.

commitment to deterrence and defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area. 

The table below shows the number of UK personnel posted to NATO Peacetime 
Establishment locations, with personnel in 39 NATO locations in 19 countries all over 
Europe and the Continental US, and the UK has proportional workforce equity at all 
locations.

Cooperation. 

James Cartlidge: 
As a founding member, the Ministry of Defence has valued the opportunities for close 
collaboration and interoperability with our allies which the Organisation for Joint 
Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) presents since 1996. We take our obligations 
under the OCCAR Convention seriously. 

Our Board of Supervisors member Vice Admiral Sir Rick Thompson meets with his

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what (a) training and (b) guidance is given to 
Special Forces personnel on the lawful use of force in conflict zones. 

James Heappey: 
All UK military personnel are held to the highest standards of conduct and 
accountable to the Secretary of State for Defence. UK military operations are 
conducted in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, and military personnel are 
bound by the laws of England and Wales for their actions under the Armed Forces 
Act 2006. 

The Government has a long-standing position of neither confirming nor denying 
information relating to the UK Special Forces, as to do so may put personnel and 
operations at risk. 

  Syria: Armed Forces 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18929] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what recent guidance his Department has 
issued to armed forces deployed in Syria on (a) international law and (b) rules of 
engagement. 

James Heappey: 
All aspects of military activity are bound by the relevant law of England and Wales, 
and international law. All UK personnel also receive annual training on both 
international law and rules of engagement. 

  Ukraine: Military Aid 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18936] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, what recent steps he has taken to increase 
military support to Ukraine. 

James Heappey: 
The UK continues to be at the forefront of international efforts to end Russia's illegal 
war in Ukraine. We will be providing Â£2.5 billion of military support to Ukraine in 
financial year 2024-25. This includes a Â£325 million package of cutting-edge drones 
and Â£245 million to procure and invigorate supply chains, to produce artillery shells to 
help fight Putin's illegal invasion.

compensation, the provision of tailored advice and assistance through the Veterans 
Welfare Service, Defence Transition Services and the Integrated Personal 
Commissioning for Veterans. 

  EDUCATION 

  Arts: Education 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18926] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking with schools to (a) 
promote creativity and (b) make pupils aware of career opportunities in the arts and 
creative industries. 

Damian Hinds: 
The department is clear that all pupils should be taught a broad and balanced 
curriculum, and all state-funded schools are required to promote pupils' cultural 
development. The best schools combine creative subjects with core subjects, and the 
department is committed to ensuring that all pupils have access to both. 

Cultural education is integral to a high-quality education. Alongside drama as part of 
the English curriculum, and dance as part of the physical education curriculum, 

music, art and design, remain important pillars of the knowledge-rich national 
curriculum. 

The department has committed over Â£714 million of funding from 2016/22 into a 
diverse portfolio of music and arts education programmes to ensure all children, 
whatever their background, have access to a high-quality education in music and 
arts. Over and above core school funding, the department will continue to invest 
around Â£115 million per year in cultural education up to 2025. 

The department funds The Careers & Enterprise Company (CEC) to support schools 
and colleges to deliver high-quality careers programmes that help make young 
people aware of a range of career opportunities, including in the arts and creative 
industries. 

CEC has supported the Discover Creative Careers programme from its inception in 
2019. Over 1,000 creative sector employers have engaged with the programme, 
leading to 92,000 student interactions with the industry. Supported by funding from 
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Discover Creative Careers 
Programme will continue to run until March 2025. Discover Creative Careers Week 
2023 saw nearly 5,000 in-person industry encounters and over 9,000 virtual 
encounters for young people. 

CEC connects business and sector bodies with schools and colleges through a 
national network of Careers Hubs, Enterprise Advisors and Cornerstone Employers, 
including Creative UK, Pinewood Studios and Creative Assembly. The Berkshire 
Careers Hub works closely with Resource Productions. A recent example of their 
work involved facilitating a networking event to support Enterprise Advisers (employer 
volunteers) to work with local schools and colleges throughout the area. Their 
website can be found here: https://www.resource-productions.co.uk/. 

Young people can access information on a range of digital tools and resources 
through the National Careers Service website. More than 800 profiles include jobs 
such as editorial assistant, music therapist and screenwriter within the creative and 
media sectors. The National Careers Service website can be found here:

  Department for Education: Defamation 

Bridget Phillipson:        

 [17568] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, with reference to paragraphs 7.16 and 7.17 
of the Ministerial Code, on how many occasions Ministers in her Department have 
informed the Law Officers that they are the defendants in a libel action in (a) their 
personal capacity, (b) their official position and (c) both since 19 December 2019. 

Damian Hinds: 
I am unable to confirm the details asked for, as this would contravene paragraph 2.13 
of the Ministerial Code, which prevents disclosure of the fact that the Law Officers 
have advised or have not advised and the content of their advice without their 
authority. 

  Education: Autism 

Daisy Cooper:        

 [18946] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will make an assessment of the 
potential impact of average waiting times for autism assessments on educational 
attainment. 

David Johnston: 
The government recognises that there can be long waits for autism assessments. 
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) is taking steps to improve access 
to assessments for autism. In 2023/24 DHSC allocated Â£4.2 million to improve 
services for autistic children and young people including assessments, pre-and post-
diagnostic support, and the continuation of the Autism in Schools programme. 
Additionally, in April 2023, NHS England published a national framework to support 
the local NHS to commission and deliver autism assessment services for children, 
young people, and adults. 

The Department for Education wants all children and young people to be able to 
reach their full potential and receive the right support to succeed in their education 
and as they move into adult life. The SEND Code of Practice is clear that meeting the 
needs of a child with SEND does not require a diagnostic label or assessment. 
Instead, the department expects teachers to monitor the progress of all children and 
young people and put support in place where needed, including arranging diagnostic 
tests where appropriate. 

The 2023 SEND and Alternative Provision Improvement Plan set out the 
departmentâs vision to improve mainstream education through setting standards for 
early and accurate identification of need, and timely access to support to meet those 
needs. The standards will clarify the types of support that should be ordinarily 
available in mainstream settings and practitioner standards will be developed to 
support frontline professionals, including one on autism. 

The departmentâs Universal Services contract brings together SEND-specific 
continuing professional development and support for the school and further education 
workforce to improve outcomes for children and young people, including those with 
autism, through one programme, which aims to reach 70% of schools and colleges in 
England per year. 

The contract offers autism awareness training and resources: over 135,000 
professionals have undertaken autism awareness training provided by the Autism 
Education Trust through the programme's train the trainer model. 

Internet: Young People 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19141] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she plans to take to help (a) 
educate young people about the dangers of internet use and (b) prevent engagement in 
harmful online activities by young people. 

 
Damian Hinds: 
As part of the statutory relationships and health educationâ¯in primary schools and 
relationships, sex and health education (RSHE)â¯in secondary schools, pupils are 
taught about online safety and harms. This includes being taught about what positive, 
healthy and respectful online relationships look like, the effects of their online actions 
on others, how to recognise and display respectful behaviour online, and where to get 
help and support for issues that occur online. The governmentâs guidance for primary 
and secondary school teaching on relationships, sex and health education can be 
found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-
relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education/relationships-education-
primary and: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/relationships-education-
relationships-and-sex-education-rse-and-health-education/relationships-and-sex-
education-rse-secondary. 

The department has updated the Teaching Online Safety in Schools non-statutory 
guidance (2023), on how to teach about all aspects of internet safety in a coordinated 
and coherent way across their curriculum. Teaching about online safety also 
complements theâ¯computing curriculum, which covers the principles of online safety 
at all key stages, with progression in the content to reflect the different and escalating 
risks that pupils face. The computing curriculum can be found here: 
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-
computing-programmes-of-study. 

The statutory âKeeping Children Safe in Educationâ guidance, which all schools and 
colleges must have regard to when drawing up and implementing their own 
safeguarding policies, has been strengthened with regards to online safety in recent 
years. Governing bodies and proprietors should ensure online safety is a running and 
interrelated theme whilst devising and implementing their whole school or college 
approach to safeguarding and related policies and procedures. This includes doing all 
that they reasonably can to limit childrenâs exposure to the harmful online content on 
the schoolâs or collegeâs IT system. 

The department has brought forward the review of the RSHE curriculum and statutory 
guidance. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to feed into the process through a 
thorough consultation. Following the consultation, the department will make a 
decision about any new content to be included in the RSHE curriculum.â¯The 
department expects to publish the revised guidance soon after. 

  Job Creation and Skilled Workers: South Holland and the Deepings 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18840] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what fiscal steps she is taking to support (a) 
training programmes, (b) apprenticeships and (c) other efforts to promote (i) job creation 
and (ii) skills development in South Holland and the Deepings constituency. 

Robert Halfon: 
Funding allocations are not available broken down to the level of individual 
constituencies. 

The government is committed to creating a world-leading skills system that is 
employer-focused, high quality and fit for the future. The departmentâs reforms are 
strengthening higher and further education to help more people get good jobs and 
upskill and retrain throughout their lives; and to improve national productivity and 
economic growth. The departmentâs reforms are backed with an additional 
investment of Â£3.8 billion over the course of this parliament to strengthen higher and 
further education. 

In the 2023/24 academic year, the department is investing nearly Â£7 billion for 
education and training places for 16 to 19 year olds, and up to 25 for those with 
special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). This funding is allocated to 
education providers to deliver study programmes and T Levels to young people. 

The department is continuing to invest in education and skills training for adults 
through the Adult Education Budget (AEB), which totalled Â£1.34 billion in the 2023/24 
Funding Year. The AEB fully funds or co-funds skills provision for eligible adults aged 
19 and above from pre-entry to Level 3, to support adults to gain the skills they need 
for work, an apprenticeship or further learning. This includes funding going to Boston 
College, which includes the Spalding Campus in the South Holland and the Deepings 
Constituency. 

The Free Courses for Jobs offer gives eligible adults the chance to access high value 
Level 3 qualification for free, which can support them to gain higher wages or a better 
job. Around 400 qualifications are available on the offer, chosen specifically as they 
offer good wage outcomes and address skills needs in the economy. There have 
been over 61,000 enrolments since April 2021. 

Skills Bootcamps are free, flexible courses of up to 16 weeks in priority skills areas, 
with a guaranteed interview upon completion. The department is expanding Skills 
Bootcamps through increased national procurement and grant funding to 30 Mayoral 
Combined Authorities and local areas to meet national and local skills needs in the 
2024/25 financial year. The department granted Great Lincolnshire LEP, in 
partnership with Lincolnshire County Council, Â£2 million for Skills Bootcamps across 
Greater Lincolnshire and Rutland in 2023, and a further Â£3 million for courses starting 
after April 2024. 

The department is increasing investment in the apprenticeships system in England to 
over Â£2.7 billion by the 2024/25 financial year to support more high quality 
apprenticeship opportunities across the country, including in South Holland and the 
Deepings. There have been over 11,000 apprenticeship starts in South Holland and 
the Deepings since 2010. 

The department has introduced employer-designed T levels, which are equipping 
thousands of young people with the skills, knowledge, and experience to access 
employment or further study in some of the most in-demand skills areas. 18 T Levels 

are now available, being delivered through over 250 providers across all regions of 
the country. University Academy Holbeach in South Holland and the Deepings 
currently offers seven T Levels and is planning to offer three more from September 
2024. 

Multiply is the governmentâs programme for improving adult numeracy. Multiply is 
funded through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which is the governmentâs flagship 
fund for supporting people and places across the UK. Up to Â£270 million is directly 
available for local areas in England to deliver innovative interventions to improve 
adult numeracy. Lincolnshire County Council has been allocated Â£4.02 million of 
Multiply funding from the 2022/23 to 2024/25 financial years to improve adult 
numeracy in their area. 

  Languages: GCE A-level 

Conor McGinn:        

 [19388] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how many and what proportion of schools in 
(a) St Helens North constituency and (b) the North West she expects to offer A-Levels in 
modern foreign languages in the next five years. 

Damian Hinds: 
The department does not produce projections of future trends of the number of 
students taking specific qualifications or future trends in the number of schools or 
colleges offering specific qualifications. 

The department recognises the importance of the study of languages in Britain and is 
taking steps to increase the number of pupils studying languages at GCSE level and 
beyond. This is particularly important given that languages became non-mandatory at 
GCSE in 2004. The recently launched Language Hubs programme is comprised of 
15 lead hub schools from across England, including a hub based in the North West. 
The lead hub schools will work with other schools in their areas to improve standards 
of language teaching, in line with recommendations of the Teaching Schools 
Councilâs 2016 âModern Foreign Languages Pedagogy Reviewâ. 

Managed by the National Consortium for Languages Education, the programme 
provides high-quality teacher Continuing Professional Development and includes 
improving transition from key stage 2 to key stage 3, increasing opportunities among 
disadvantaged pupils to study languages, and increasing the access to home, 
heritage, and community languages. 

  Music: Education 

Barbara Keeley:        

 [19581] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, how many times the national plan for music 
education monitoring board has met since it was established; and on how many 
occasions a Minister attended a meeting of the board. 

Barbara Keeley:        

 [19582] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, whether her Department plans to publish 
minutes for the meetings of the national plan for music education monitoring board. 

Damian Hinds: 
The National Plan for Music Education Monitoring Board has met three times since 
the announcement of the Board in June 2023. The second meeting was attended by 
the former Minister of State for Schools. The terms of reference of the Board are 
published on GOV.UK and there are no plans to publish the minutes of these 
meetings. The âNational plan for music education monitoring board terms of 
referenceâ can be found here: 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachm
ent_data/file/1162481/National_plan_for_music_education_monitoring_board_terms_
of_reference_-_June_2023.pdf. 

  Pupils: Per Capita Costs 

Catherine McKinnell:        

 [18153] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will publish the average condition 
funding required per pupil by local authority. 

Damian Hinds: 
Responsibility for keeping buildings safe and well-maintained lies with schools and 
their responsible bodies, such as local authorities, academy trusts and voluntary-
aided bodies. The department supports these bodies by providing capital funding, 
delivering major rebuilding programmes, and offering guidance and support. 

The department has allocated over Â£15 billion since 2015 for keeping schools safe 
and operational, including Â£1.8 billion in the 2023/24 financial year. The departmentâs 
aim for condition funding is that responsible bodies receive a fair share of the 
available budget that takes account of their relative condition need. The department 
uses consistent data on the condition of the school estate to inform the allocation of 
funding. This means that the department targets more funding to where it is needed 
most, with schools in relatively poorer condition attracting more funding for their 
responsible body. It is then up to responsible bodies to use their local knowledge of 
priorities to target this investment. 

This government introduced the Condition Data Collection (CDC), the first ever 
comprehensive survey of the school estate and one of the largest data collection 
programmes of its kind in Europe. Thanks to the departmentâs evidence led 
approach, following the James Review of Capital in 2011, this government has been 
able to allocate capital funding based on consistent data on condition need. Almost 
all government funded schools in England were visited as part of CDC during 2017 to 
2019. As part of this, surveyors and engineers assessed the condition of multiple 
building and land components. This data was then used to estimate the remediation 
cost to bring all building components back to new or performing as intended. More 
information is available at: 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60af7cbbe90e071b54214c82/Conditio
n_of_School_Buildings_Survey_CDC1_-_key_findings_report.pdf. This includes a 
regional breakdown of condition need. 

CDC uses floor area of buildings rather than pupil numbers as a consistent approach 
to assessing buildings, alongside data on the condition of buildings. This is the 
approach also used in CDC2, the successor programme to CDC, which is underway 
and is due to complete in 2026. The average floor area per pupil varies depending on 
several factors, including the phase of education and type of school. Therefore, this is 
not an estimate that the department makes. 

  Schools: Buildings 

Catherine McKinnell:        

 [18440] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will have discussions with (a) 
responsible bodies and (b) local authorities on their school estate management capability. 

Damian Hinds: 
Responsibility for keeping buildings safe and well-maintained lies with schools and 
their responsible bodies, such as local authorities, academy trusts and voluntary-
aided bodies. The department supports these bodies by providing capital funding, 
delivering major rebuilding programmes, and offering guidance and support. 

Ministers have regular conversations with schools and their responsible bodies about 
school buildings and the management of their estates. Departmental officials also 
have regular conversations about estate management capability with organisations 
representing responsible bodies, as well as school estate management professionals 
with day-to-day experience managing their school estates to develop and improve the 
support the department offers. 

The department regularly reminds responsible bodies of their legal duty to keep their 
buildings safe and maintain them in good order. Last year, the department updated 
the Academy Trust Handbook, adding a requirement for accounting officers to 
confirm that they are managing their estates in line with their existing responsibilities, 
as well as signposting to further guidance. 

The department provides guidance, tools and support to help schools and 
responsible bodies effectively manage their school buildings and keep them safe, 
including the good estate management for schools (GEMS) guidance, which is 
available at: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/good-estate-management-for-schools. In 
addition, the Capital Advisers Programme is providing direct support to help academy 
trusts improve their estate management, by offering best practice recommendations 
from experienced technical advisers, in line with GEMS. 

  Schools: Finance 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18913] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will make an assessment of the 
potential merits of allocating a portion of the savings in direct schools grants from home 
education to local authorities to provide exam centres. 

Damian Hinds: 
The department allocates school funding to local authorities through the dedicated 
schools grant, on the basis of pupil numbers in the preceding autumn census. That 
some children are home educated does not, therefore, lead to unallocated funding. 
The department does not have current plans to fund exam centres for children who 
are home educated, but all funding is kept under careful review. Local authorities do 
have some flexibility to support children and young people who are home educated. 

  Schools: Governing Bodies 

Mike Amesbury:        

 [19168] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what assessment she has made of the 
effectiveness of measures available to school governing bodies to investigate complaints. 

Damian Hinds: 
In academy trusts, trust boards must ensure there is a procedure to deal with 
complaints from parents and carers and other individuals to meet their legal duties. In 
maintained schools, governing bodies must establish procedures to deal with all 
complaints about the school and any community facilities or services it provides, 
unless alternate statutory procedures apply as outlined in Section 29(1) of the 
Education Act 2002. 

  Special Educational Needs 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18903] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to ensure that her 
Department works with (a) local authorities and (b) the Department of Health and Social 
Care to provide joined up services for children with SEND. 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18904] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, what steps she is taking to ensure that local 
authorities are more involved in the delivery of (a) education and (b) health services for 
children with SEND. 

David Johnston: 
Local authorities already have existing statutory responsibilities to develop, publish 
and review the special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) local offer, to 
ensure that the range of provision and services available in their local area are 
sufficient and well suited to the needs of children with SEND. 

In the SEND and Alternative Provision (AP) Improvement Plan, the department have 
committed to establishing new local SEND and AP partnerships, convened by the 
local authority, that will bring together local partners to strategically plan and 
commission support for children and young people with SEND and AP. SEND and 
AP partnerships are a collaborative network of individuals, including health 
commissioners and education providers, who are working together to strategically 
plan SEND services. They will be underpinned by strengthened accountabilities and 
improved use of data for all those responsible for local delivery. 

Moreover, the department has established a steering group to oversee a joint 
Department for Education and Department of Health and Social Care approach to 
SEND workforce planning. This feeds into the National SEND and AP Implementation 
Board and aims to be complete by 2025. The work will build on the NHS Long Term 
Workforce Plan published in June 2023, which sets out the steps the NHS and its 
partners need to take to deliver an NHS workforce that meets the changing needs of 
the population over the next 15 years. 

The Improvement Plan also committed to the Change Programme which was 
launched in September 2023, and is testing key SEND and AP reforms with 32 local 
authorities in each of the 9 regions. The department, working with its Delivery 
Partner, Reaching Excellence and Ambition for all Children (REACh), are providing 
these local authorities with âboots on the groundâ support for the testing of these 
reforms. We are also running a live feedback loop that is providing early insights into 
how the reforms and supporting documents are working and identifying required 
changes. 

  Teachers: Workplace Pensions 

Barbara Keeley:        

 [19580] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, if she will make an estimate of the potential 
impact of ending funding for employers' contributions to the teachers' pension scheme for 
music teachers employed by music hubs unattached to schools on costs to the public 
purse. 

Damian Hinds: 
In March 2024, the department announced an additional Â£1.1 billion in the 2024/25 
financial year to support schools and local authorities with the increased Teachersâ 
Pension Scheme employer contribution rate. This additional funding will be 
distributed in 2024/25 via the new teachersâ pension employer contribution grant 
(TPECG) 2024. 

The department is providing additional funding through the TPECG 2024 to local 
authorities in respect of teachers categorised as centrally employed on the schoolsâ 
workforce census 2023. The department expects local authority-based Music Hub 
teachers to be recorded on the schoolsâ workforce census, and so to be in scope for 
this grant. 

The department has also committed to providing funding to cover the increase in 
employer contribution rates for existing non-local authority hubs for the current 
academic year, until August 2024, and officials are working to agree the precise 
amount. Further details, including funding rates and allocations, will be provided 
soon. 

  Teaching Methods 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [19646] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Education, whether she has made an assessment of the 
potential merits of using nurture teaching methods in classrooms. 

Damian Hinds: 
Every state-funded school must offer a broad and balanced curriculum which 
supports every child to fulfil their potential. The department encourages schools to 
deliver this using effective and evidence-based teaching practices, drawing on 
resources such as the Education Endowment Foundationâs Teaching and Learning 
Toolkit. 

The department does not endorse any one approach to behaviour management over 
another and it trusts school leaders to develop policies which reflect their schoolâs 
individual needs. The departmentâs âBehaviour in Schoolsâ guidance focuses on 
helping schools to establish calm, safe and supportive environments by creating 
positive cultures which work for everyone. 

  ENERGY SECURITY AND NET ZERO 

  Energy: Conservation 

Alan Brown:        

 [19396] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, whether her Department 
has plans to roll out a national energy efficiency advice service. 

Amanda Solloway: 
The Government has launched several digital services aimed at improving people's 
access to energy efficiency information and advice. The âFind Ways to Save Energy 
in Your Homeâ service provides tailored and independent recommendations for home 
improvement and retrofit. This can be found at:https://www.gov.uk/improve-energy-
efficiency 

Additionally, consumers can check their eligibility for either the Great British 
Insulation Scheme or the Home Upgrade Grant scheme. These services are 
supported by a phoneline, to help those needing more bespoke support or those 
digitally excluded. The Government will continue to improve and expand these 
services based on user insight and feedback. 

  Energy: Prices 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19760] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, if he will make an 
assessment of the potential impact of increasing the energy price cap on household 
default tariffs on (a) the average annual energy bill for households and (b) trends in the 
level of profits of energy companies. 

Amanda Solloway: 
Decisions on the price cap are for independent regulator Ofgem. Average energy bills 
are published online at 
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/65c65524cc433b0011a90ba8/table_2
21.xlsx 

A break down of the components of the price cap, including the earnings allowance, 
may be found at www.ofgem.gov.uk/energy-price-cap. 

  Energy: Standing Charges 

Mick Whitley:        

 [19181] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, whether she has made 
an assessment of the level of daily standing charges for (a) gas and (b) electricity in (i) 
North Wales and (ii) Merseyside. 

Amanda Solloway: 
Standing charges are regulated by Ofgem. Regional standing charges may be found 
online at www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/get-
energy-price-cap-standing-charges-and-unit-rates-region . 

The main factor determining differences in standing charges is the cost of operating 
and maintaining the gas and electricity networks in each region. 

Mick Whitley:        

 [19182] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, whether her Department 
has made an assessment of the potential impact of regional variations in (a) energy costs 
and (b) daily standing charges for (i) electricity and (ii) gas on regional economic 
inequalities. 

Amanda Solloway: 
Standing charges are a commercial matter for suppliers, although Ofgem regulates 
standing charges as they do with other elements of billing. This includes setting a cap 
on standing charges as part of the overall default tariff cap. 

The variance in standing charges is partially due to regional differences in energy 
distribution costs. These costs reflect the expenses of maintaining and upgrading the 
distribution network in a specific area, and the number of consumers those costs are 
spread across. 

Ofgem launched a call for input on standing charges, which closed on Friday 19 
January 2024, looking at how it is applied to energy bills and what alternatives could 
be considered. 

Mick Whitley:        

 [19183] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, whether her Department 
has had discussions with energy suppliers on taking steps to reduce the daily standing 
charges for gas and electricity in (a) North Wales and (b) Merseyside to at least the 
national average. 

Amanda Solloway: 
The regulation of standing charges is a matter for Ofgem. The cost of distributing 
electricity varies regionally, mirroring differences in distribution expenses across the 
country. These disparities stem from maintaining and upgrading distribution networks 
in specific areas and the number of consumers sharing these costs. Consequently, 
less densely populated and remote regions incur higher operational expenses. 

Ofgem launched a call for input on standing charges, which closed in January 2024, 
looking at how they are applied to energy bills and what alternatives could be 
considered. I am supportive of Ofgemâs decision to gather information and evidence 
on the current standing charge model. Ofgem are currently assessing the responses 
received and will publish a decision in due course here: 
www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/launch-review-standing-charges-energy-bills. 

Mick Whitley:        

 [19184] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, pursuant to the Answer 
of 12 February 2024 to Question 13068 on Energy: Standing Charges, whether her 
Department has had discussions with Ofgem on the equitability of daily standing charges 
for gas and electricity in (a) North Wales and (b) Merseyside. 

Amanda Solloway: 
I regularly meet with Ofgem to discuss the energy retail market, including standing 
charges. Ofgemâs recent Call for Input (CfI) on standing charges closed on January 
19th 2024. Ofgem are considering the responses they received and are thinking about 
next steps. 

Network charges vary by region to reflect the different costs of supplying consumers 
in each region. In 2015, Ofgem carried out an assessment of moving away from 
regional charging and the assessment showed that it would risk an increase in overall 
costs and reduce accountability to the customers being served. 

  Fuel Poverty 

Alan Brown:        

 [19394] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, whether her Department 
has made an assessment of the potential merits of including (a) LED lighting, (b) water 
efficiency devices and (c) other bill-saving technologies in the scope of (i) the Energy 
Company Obligation and (ii) other fuel poverty schemes. 

Amanda Solloway: 
Under current assessments, Government energy efficiency schemes prioritise 
measures that have beneficial long-term effects on lowering bills and making homes 
more comfortable and affordable to live in. 

Current schemes allow the installation of measures which improve the energy 
performance of a dwelling within the scope of the âStandard Assessment Procedureâ 
(SAP) â which assesses the energy performance of dwellings. 

This can include measures such as solid wall insulation, cavity wall insulation, loft 
insulation, underfloor insulation, draught-proofing, air source heat pumps, ground 
source heat pumps, high heat retention storage heating, low energy lighting, solar 
PV, solar thermal and heating controls. 

  Heat Pumps: Social Rented Housing 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18921] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, what steps her 
Department is taking to support clean heat installations in Wave 3 of the Social Housing 
Decarbonisation Fund. 

Amanda Solloway: 
The Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF) is a 10-year, Â£3.8bn 2019 
manifesto commitment. To date, total committed grant funding for SHDF and the 
associated demonstrator is over Â£1bn. The Â£6bn energy efficiency support package 
announced in December 2023 allocated Â£1.25bn towards the SHDF between 2025 
and 2028. This funding will provide long-term certainty, support supply chain growth, 
and ensure we can scale up our delivery over time. SHDF Wave 3 is still being 
designed but it will continue to provide incentives and funding for the installation of 
low carbon heating technologies in social housing. 

  Heating: Carbon Emissions 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18919] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, if she will make an 
assessment of the role of shared ground loops in decarbonising heat for properties 
without the space for individual heat pumps. 

Amanda Solloway: 
Heat pumps connected to shared ground loops have a role to play in decarbonising 
heat, particularly in properties, like blocks of flats, that might otherwise be less well 
suited to individual heat pumps. To support their installation, the Government has 
announced that it will increase the capacity limit for shared ground loops under the 
Boiler Upgrade Scheme from 45kW to 300kW. Additionally, we have supported the 
installation of shared ground loops under schemes like the Social Housing 
Decarbonisation Fund. 

  Offshore Industry: Employment 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [18876] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, pursuant to the Answer 
of 7 March 2024 to Question 16114 on Offshore Industry: Employment, whether Offshore 
Energies UK has provided her Department with the methodology it uses to estimate the 
number of (a) direct, (b) indirect and (c) induced jobs supported by the oil and gas sector. 

Graham Stuart: 
The workforce estimates developed by OEUK come from statistics provided by the 
data analysis company Experian, who in turn use government jobs data and track 
expenditure as it flows through the economy. OEUK have previously shared some 
underlying data with the department, but OEUK produce these figures independently 
of Government. 

These workforce figures have been collected and published since 2007. 

  Offshore Industry: Licensing 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19307] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, with reference to the 
judgement of the Oslo District Court in case number 23-099330TVI-TOSL/05 on 18 
January 2024, if she will make it her policy to take account of the impact of scope 3 
emissions on global temperatures when licencing new oil and gas projects. 

Graham Stuart: 
Under the Climate Change Act 2008 we are required to follow international guidelines 
on emissions reporting, which require emissions from the burning of oil and gas to be 
accounted for in the country in which they are used. This is in line with guidance from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 

Emissions from UK oil and gas extraction are accounted for in our legally-binding 
carbon budgets. This includes projected future emissions from new licensing rounds. 
The judgment of the Oslo District Court does not change this. 

  ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS 

  Climate Change: Marine Environment 

Afzal Khan:        

 [19453] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether he has 
made an assessment of the potential connection between global ocean protection and 
mitigating the effects of climate change. 

Rebecca Pow: 
The Government recognises that climate change and biodiversity loss, alongside 
other human pressures, are having a detrimental impact on ocean health. Ocean 
action can be part of our response to both challenges; protecting and restoring 

coastal and marine habitats can provide a wide array of benefits, including flood 
protection, improving biodiversity, carbon sequestration and supporting ecosystems 
to be more resilient to climate impacts. 

The UK plays a leading role in advocating for nature and ocean to be embedded in 
global climate action. The annual UNFCCC Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue 
was established under our COP26 Presidency. At COP28, we worked with 
international partners to secure a negotiated decision for the first Global Stocktake 
which encouraged the strengthening of ocean-based climate action. 

As Chair of the Global Ocean Alliance, the UK successfully led calls for ambitious 
and meaningful outcomes for the ocean from the Convention on Biological Diversity 
COP15. As agreed at that COP, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity 
Framework includes commitments to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 
2030, restore degraded ecosystems and to tackle the impacts of climate change and 
ocean acidification, with Parties noting the interlinkage between these targets. 

The UK played a significant and proactive role in securing The Biodiversity Beyond 
National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement which will mean much greater protection for 
the two-thirds of the global ocean that lies beyond national jurisdiction. The 
Agreement will play a key role supporting the delivery of the Kunming-Montreal 
Global Biodiversity Framework, including helping to achieve the target to effectively 
conserve and manage at least 30% of the ocean by 2030. 

Financed from the UK aid budget, the Â£500 million Blue Planet Fund supports 
developing countries to reduce poverty, protect and sustainably manage their marine 
resources and address human-generated threats across four interlinked key themes, 
one of which is climate change. 

  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: Legal Costs 

Jonathan Ashworth:        

 [19062] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what the total cost 
to the public purse was of legal (a) support and (b) representation to Ministers in his 
Department in relation to their official conduct in each of the last three years. 

Mark Spencer: 
Such information is not centrally recorded or collated in the form requested. More 
generally, I would refer the hon. Member to the long-standing policies on legal 
expenditure, as set out recently by Cabinet Office Ministers on 12 March 2004, 
Official Report, PQ 17709 and 12 March 2024, Official Report, House of Lords, Cols. 
1901-1904. 

  Droughts and Water Supply 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19038] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps he is 
taking to tackle the risk of (a) drought and (b) water scarcity. 

Robbie Moore: 
(a) Defra published its Plan for Water 2023 which set out the importance of ensuring 
a clean and plentiful water supply in England. The Plan sets out our commitment to a 
twin track approach to improving water supply resilience, with action to reduce water 
company leaks and improve water efficiency, alongside investing in new supply 
infrastructure. 

Last year, regional water resources groups and water companies consulted on their 
draft water resources plans. These statutory plans set out how each company will 
secure water supplies sustainably for at least the next 25 years and how drought 
resilience will be improved. The plans contain proposals for multiple new water 
resources schemes, including new reservoirs. Water companies also maintain 
statutory drought plans, which show the actions taken to maintain secure supplies 
during droughts. 

(b) To address water scarcity, the Government has set a new legally binding target 
under the Environment Act 2021 to reduce the use of our public water supply in 
England by 20% per person by 2038.â¯ To achieve this, we will reduce household 
water use to 122 litres per person per day, reduce leakage by 37%, and reduce non-
household (for example, businesses) water use by 9% by 31 March 2038. This is part 
of the trajectory to achieving 110 litres per person per day household water use, a 
50% reduction in leakage and a 15% reduction in non-household water use by 2050. 
Our Plan for Water and Environmental Improvement Plan have set out our roadmap 
to water efficiency in new developments and retrofits, to be delivered over the next 
decade. This includes developing clear guidance on âwater positiveâ or ânet zero 
waterâ developments and roles for developers and water companies, including water 
company incentives. We are also working closely with water companies to increase 
the supply of water. 

In December 2023, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities 
issued a Written Ministerial Statement which set out that in areas of serious water 
stress, where water scarcity is inhibiting the adoption of Local Plans or the granting of 
planning permission for homes, we are encouraging local planning authorities to work 
with the Environment Agency and delivery partners to agree standards tighter than 
the 110 litres per day set out in current guidance. Defra will also be reviewing building 
regulations in spring 2024 to allow local planning authorities to introduce tighter water 
efficiency standards in new homes. Defra is also reviewing the evidence base for 
water reuse systems with a view to consulting on changes to the water supply 
regulations to enable greywater reuse and rainwater harvesting to be managed by 
water companies. 

At Spring Budget 2024, the Government published a policy paper setting out its 
ambition to address water scarcity in Greater Cambridge and measures to achieve 
this. It builds on significant interventions and investment of nearly Â£9 million - 
including Â£5.8 million of new funding - announced last July and at Autumn Statement 
2023. 

  Environmental Protection 

Anthony Mangnall:        

 [17637] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment 
he has made of the adequacy of the Environment Agency's feedback to members of the 
public who report environmental incidents. 

Robbie Moore: 
An Environment Agency local team can choose to give feedback or request further 
information regarding an incident if needed, but the Environment Agency Information 
Communications Service (ICS) who receive reports of environmental incidents from 
the public, will not provide feedback. 

  Fisheries 

Daniel Zeichner:        

 [18720] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if he will publish 
the scientific (a) findings and (b) advice submitted by the Government to the International 
Centre for the Exploration of the Seas in respect of pollack in area VI(6) and area VII(7) in 
(i) 2022 and (ii) 2023. 

Mark Spencer: 
You asked if the Department will publish the scientific findings and advice submitted 
by the Government to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) 
in respect of pollack in area 6 and area 7 in 2022 and 2023. The Centre for 
Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) and the Department do not 
submit advice to ICES but rather collaborate with the ICES community to generate 
advice using the available evidence. ICES publish the information used in stock 
assessments on their website. Scientific findings from projects, such as the 
forthcoming pollack population size study in the western English Channel, are shared 
with ICES and published on the Departmentâs website. 

Daniel Zeichner:        

 [18721] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, with reference to 
his Department's press release entitled Government announces next steps to support 
pollack fishermen, published on 23 February 2024, and the Centre for Environment 
Fisheries and Aquaculture Science's invitation to commercial fishers to register an 
interest in the forthcoming pollack population size study in the western English Channel, 
published on 12 March 2024, what the (a) estimated cost and (b) planned timetable for 
the study is; and what plans he has to publish (i) analysis and (ii) a report of this work for 
the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. 

Mark Spencer: 
You asked for details (cost, timeline and publication plans) of the forthcoming pollack 
population size study in the western English Channel, published on 12 March 2024. 
The Department is not able to release the estimated cost of the study at this point in 
time. The indicative timeline of the study is as follows: 

â¢  12 March 2024 â Opening date to register interest 

â¢  26 March 2024 â Closing date to register interest 

â¢  27-28 March 2024 â Application pack issued to those registered 

â¢  10 April 2024 â Closing date for submitting applications 

â¢  End of April 2024 â Vessels selected and feedback provided to all applicants 

â¢  Mid-May (dates TBC) 2024 â Training for successful applicants 

â¢  Late May 2024 to February 2025 - Sampling programme duration 

Once the data analysis is complete, the results will be shared with the International 
Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and published on the Departmentâs 
website. 

  Flood Control 

Emma Hardy:        

 [18569] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, with reference to 
page 13 of the the National Audit Office report entitled Resilience to flooding, published 
on 15 November 2023, how many (a) projects have been cancelled and (b) homes will no 
longer be better protected; and where those homes are located, by local authority area. 

Robbie Moore: 
In March 2020, the Government doubled its investment in flood defences to a record 
Â£5.2 billion between 2021 and 2027 to better protect communities across England 
from flooding and coastal erosion. Since April 2021, over Â£1.5 billion has been 
invested in over 200 flood protection schemes, better protecting over 71,000 
properties. 

The capital investment programme is annually reviewed and updated to 
accommodate changes, including the introduction of new schemes or urgent works. 

The Government is aware of the challenges and delays caused by inflation and the 
availability of skills and labour across the sector. The start of the programme was 
also impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in fewer people to 
develop projects and delayed mobilisation of construction activity. 

As stated in the NAO report, the Environment Agency forecast that 1,500 projects will 
provide better protection to 200,000 properties by the end of the programme in March 
2027. 

Delivery is the Governmentâs key priority, and we are working with the Environment 
Agency to review the programme in the light of the impacts of inflation and the 
pandemic. More information will be available in due course. 

  Flood Control: Lowestoft 

Emma Hardy:        

 [18570] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment 
he has made of the status of the Lowestoft Tidal Barrier following the reduction in the 
number of projects to be completed by the Environment Agency as part of its programme 
of flood and coastal erosion risk management schemes to 2027. 

Robbie Moore: 
In March 2020, the government doubled its investment in flood defences to a record 
Â£5.2 billion between 2021 and 2027 to better protect communities across England 
from flooding and coastal erosion. Since April 2021, over Â£1.5 billion has been 
invested in over 200 flood protection schemes, better protecting over 71,000 
properties. 

Defra has allocated over Â£80 million to the Lowestoft Flood Risk Management 
Scheme. The first two of three phases have been completed successfully. 

Like many other infrastructure projects, cost have increased significantly over the last 
years. Defra is aware that East Suffolk Council halted the scheme in January due to a 
significant funding shortfall. 

Defra would encourage the council to work with EA and other potential partners to 
explore additional funding in line with Governmentâs Partnership Funding principles. 

The EA and Defra are continuing to engage with East Suffolk Council to identify 
options for developing a viable proposal. 

  Fluorinated Gases: Regulation 

Steven Bonnar:        

 [19472] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his 
Department is taking with industry to develop policies on fluorinated gas regulation. 

Steven Bonnar:        

 [19473] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps his 
department is taking to work with industry on fluorinated gas regulation. 

Steven Bonnar:        

 [19474] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment 
he has made of the adequacy of regulations on fluorinated gas in helping to reduce 
emissions leakage. 

Robbie Moore: 
We are in the process of reviewing the GB F-gas Regulation and have engaged with 
industry throughout this process. As part of this work, we undertook a comprehensive 
review of the GB F-gas Regulation and published an assessment report in December 
2022, which included assessing measures related to leakage of F-gases. We intend 
to consult on proposals for change to the GB F-gas Regulation in due course. 

  Gardens: Waste Disposal 

Mr Toby Perkins:        

 [19043] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which local 
authorities (a) charged for collection of garden waste and b) provided a free garden waste 
service in 2023/24. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not hold this data. 

Under section 45(3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 waste collection 
authorities are permitted to charge a reasonable amount for the collection of garden 
waste. 

Local Authorities are best placed to determine the effective delivery of local services. 

Mr Toby Perkins:        

 [19044] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what information 
his Department holds on the number of local authorities that charged an annual fee of (a) 
less than Â£30, (b) Â£30.01- Â£40, (c) Â£40.01- Â£50, (d) Â£50.01- Â£75, (e) Â£75.01- Â£100.00 and 
(f) Â£100.01 or more for the collection of garden waste in the 2023-24 financial year. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not hold this data. 

  Microplastics: Pollution 

Kerry McCarthy:        

 [18683] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether his 
Department is taking steps to help tackle microplastic pollution originating from textiles. 

Robbie Moore: 
Microplastics can enter the environment from several sources such as vehicle tyre 
wear, machine-washing clothes and from textiles themselves. 

Defra funded a rapid evidence assessment in 2022 to better understand the costs, 
benefits, and efficiencies of installing filters in washing machines to trap textile 
microfibres during the laundry cycle and before discharge to wastewater treatment 
works. Evidence gaps were identified from the review and the conclusion was made 
that further information is required to meet the legal framework to drive action. For 
example, there is a need to better understand how to avert additional costs incurred 
by consumers of new washing machines with filters, and the consumerâs sustainable 
disposal of used filters. We need to ensure all evidence to support the introduction of 
filters is robust and fully reviewed. We have conveyed this to the industry, and we 
look forward to any proposals they are able to share when they are able to do so. 

We are also working with the UK water industry to understand the effectiveness of 
other interventions in the wastewater system to tackle microplastic pollution and to 
characterise and quantify microplastics and fibres entering wastewater treatment 
works. Research to-date shows that wastewater treatment plants are effective at 

removing microplastics and -fibres from wastewater from the home environment, with 
up to 99% of microplastic particles removed throughout the wastewater treatment 
process. 

Kerry McCarthy:        

 [19564] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment 
he has made of the extent of the impact of the (a) design and (b) manufacture of textiles 
on microplastic pollution. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Department has not made (actual) assessments of the impact of the design and 
manufacture of textiles on environmental microplastic pollution. Defra recently funded 
a project to develop and validate methods to detect, quantify and characterise 
microplastics and microplastic fibres from textiles used in clothing in rivers and their 
sediments. The techniques were tested on urban and rural rivers, and it was found 
higher levels of microplastics were present in the urban river. 

Defra provided grant funding of Â£860000 to WRAP's Textiles 2030, which began in 
2021. The programme brings together brands & retailers representing more than 62% 
of all clothing placed on the UK market to drive industry collaboration on circular 
design, circular business models, (resale, rental, subscription, repair, recycling) and 
closing the loop on materials (recycling). 

  Sewage: Pollution 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18260] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if he will make an 
assessment of the potential merits of establishing an independent reporting mechanism 
for assessing sewage pollution by water companies. 

Robbie Moore: 
We have increased the number of storm overflows monitored across the network in 
England from approximately 7% in 2010, to 100% coverage before the end of 2023. 
These event duration monitors will provide a complete picture of when, and for how 
long, each storm overflow operates. 

Under our landmark Environment Act, we made it a legal requirement for companies 
to provide discharge data to the Environment Agency and to make it available in near 
real time to the public. By bringing in this comprehensive monitoring, this government 
and its regulators have enabled the extent of sewage discharges to be revealed, so 
we are better equipped to tackle this challenge. 

In April 2023, we also launched our consultation on Continuous Water Quality 
Monitoring and Event Duration Monitoring. This outlines the governmentâs proposals 
to enhance the monitoring of storm overflow and final effluent discharges. 
Governmentâs response to this consultation was issued on 14 September 2023, and 
water companies are now taking forward plans to implement this programme from 
2025. 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18261] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what recent 
discussions he has had with water companies on (a) preventative measures to stop 
sewage dumping and (b) improving infrastructure. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Secretary of State has regular engagement with water companies to discuss a 
range of issues including preventative measures to reduce sewage discharges, and 
improvements to water company infrastructure. 

For example, in December 2023, he wrote to all water company Chief Executives, 
requesting that they improve sewer maintenance programmes over the next twelve 
months to help prevent storm overflow discharges. This programme will support the 
stringent targets set out in the governmentâs Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction 
Plan, which will drive the largest infrastructure programme in water company history 
of Â£60 billion over 25 years. 

On 11 March, the Government announced the additional fast-tracked investment of 
Â£180 million over the next 12 months to help reduce sewage spills. This is expected 
to prevent more than 8000 sewage spills polluting English waterways. 

  Sewage: Rivers 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18739] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, whether he has 
made an assessment of the potential merits of infrastructure in preventing sewage 
releases into rivers. 

Robbie Moore: 
Through the Governmentâs Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, we have set 
stringent targets for water companies to reduce the use of storm overflows, driving 
the largest infrastructure programme in water company history of Â£60 billion over 25 
years. We expect water companies to utilise a natural capital approach, considering 
carbon reduction and biodiversity net gain, as well as catchment level and nature-
based solutions in their planning where possible. 

Water company investment in environmental improvements has been scaled up to 
Â£7.1 billion over the period 2020 â 25. This includes Â£3.1 billion invested in storm 
overflow improvements specifically. Moreover, we expect water companies to use the 
next five-year Price Review period (2025-2030) to set bold and ambitious plans that 
deliver for people and the environment. 

On 11 March, the Government announced additional fast-tracked investment of 
Â£180m over the next 12 months into improving sewer infrastructure. This is expected 
to prevent more than 8000 sewage spills polluting English waterways. 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18740] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if he will take 
steps to move water companies that do not restrict sewage spills under an operator of 
last resort. 

Robbie Moore: 
There is no operator of last resort for water companies. Ofwat monitors the 
performance and financial position of all water companies and publishes results on 
these annually. Ofwat will take action when water company performance is not at the 
level Government expect, or if their investors need to strengthen their long-term 
financial resilience. 

This Government is holding the water industry to account on a scale never seen 
before. We have legislated to introduce unlimited penalties on water companies who 
breach their environmental permits and expand the range of offences to which 
penalties can be applied. Furthermore, on 20 February, the Government and 
Environment Agency (EA) announced that they will quadruple the number of water 
company inspections to crack down on poor performing companies. 

We will continue to hold water companies to account and if there are illegal breaches 
of permits, the regulators will not hesitate to take robust action. 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18742] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what steps he is 
taking to provide public health warnings over the risk to (a) people and (b) animals of 
entering rivers into which sewage has been released. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Government directed water companies to increase their storm overflow 
monitoring in 2013 and achieved 100% event duration monitoring (EDM) coverage 
before the end of 2023. EDM data shows when storm overflows are discharging, and 
how long discharges have lasted for. The wealth of data collected from these 
monitors will ensure that we know the full extent of the problem â increasing 
transparency, revealing the worst-offending overflows, and enabling regulators to 
hold polluters to account. 

In addition, the Environment Agency takes over 7,000 samples each year at 
Englandâs 424 designated bathing waters, which are used to determine the annual 
bathing water classifications. These classifications are displayed on signage at 
bathing waters and online on the Environment Agencyâs Swimfo website, to allow 
bathers to make informed decisions before entering the water. If there is a pollution 
incident, a notification is posted on the Swimfo website and on signage at the bathing 
water. Throughout the bathing season, the Environment Agency makes daily pollution 
risk forecasts for a number of bathing waters, where water quality may be temporarily 
reduced due to factors such as heavy rainfall, wind or the tide. When a temporary 
reduction in water quality is forecast, the Environment Agency issues a pollution risk 
warning and advice against bathing, enabling bathers to avoid times or locations 

where the risk of pollution is higher than normal and health risks from bathing may be 
higher than the annual classification suggests. To reduce risk to health from bathing 
waters, the UK Health Security Agency and the Environment Agency offer advice in 
their âSwim Healthyâ guidance, which is available to read before making any decision 
on swimming. 

  Water Supply 

Derek Twigg:        

 [18377] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if she will make an 
assessment of the potential impact of trends in the number of (a) data centres and (b) AI 
infrastructure on demand for water in the next 10 years. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Environment Agency will be publishing its updated National Framework for Water 
Resources in 2025. This will reflect the expectation that regional water resources 
plans explore opportunities to deliver cross sector mutual benefits, as set out in a 
joint letter from Government and water regulators to regional water resources groups 
in January 2023. 

This will include the need to work with data centre and AI industries to establish and 
understand their potential water demands, seeking to identify potential mutually 
beneficial solutions. 

In some parts of England which are designated as water stressed, water companies 
may not be able to supply the required volume of water. The data centre and AI 
industry will need to investigate and plan for alternative sources of water, including on 
site water storage and water recycling. 

  Water Treatment: Plastics 

Kerry McCarthy:        

 [19009] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, what assessment 
he has made of the effectiveness of wastewater treatment networks in filtering out 
microplastics. 

Robbie Moore: 
Government recently funded an external rapid evidence assessment to better 
understand the costs, benefits, and efficiencies of installing filters in washing 
machines. The filters aim to trap textile microplastic fibres during the laundry cycle 
and before discharge to sewer networks and wastewater treatment works. The 
assessment concluded further evidence was needed to determine how to avert 
additional costs incurred by consumers of new washing machines with filters, and the 
consumerâs sustainable disposal of used filters. 

A water industry investigation of the levels and types of microplastics entering a 
range of UK wastewater treatment works reported that conventional treatment can 
remove 99% of microplastics by number and 99.5% by mass. 

  Zane Gbangbola 

Ellie Reeves:        

 [19662] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, if he will make an 
assessment of the potential merits of opening an independent public inquiry into the 
death of Zane Gbangbola during flooding in 2014. 

Robbie Moore: 
The Surrey Senior Coroner has already carried out a full investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding Zane Gbangbolaâs death, taking into account a 
considerable amount of evidence.â¯ The Coroner, as an independent judicial office 
holder, drew his own conclusions based on this evidence. 

If there is a belief that the evidence was not considered properly during the original 
inquest, or that there is new evidence available, the correct process is for an 
application to be made to the Attorney General asking her to apply to the High Court 
to quash the inquest and order a fresh investigation.â¯The High Court would take this 
course of action if it believed that it would be in the interests of justice. 

I believe that this remains the proper process to follow. An assessment of the merits 
of an inquiry should be made at the appropriate time if, and when, the legal 
processes have been exhausted. 

  FOREIGN, COMMONWEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT OFFICE 

  Colombia: Ceasefires 

Ian Byrne:        

[R]  [19502] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
discussions he has had with his counterpart in Colombia on the recent ceasefire with the 
ELN. 

David Rutley: 
As penholder at the UN Security Council, the UK helped coordinate international 
support to expand the mandate of the UN Verification Mission in Colombia to verify 
the implementation of the ceasefire between the Colombian government and the 
National Liberation Army (ELN). The ceasefire agreed between the Colombian 
Government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) and its extension following 
recent talks in Havana is a welcome step. During my visit to Colombia earlier this 
month, I [Minister Rutley] was able to convey our hope that the ceasefire will 
contribute to improving security and alleviate the suffering of conflict-affected 
communities. 

  Colombia: Peace Negotiations 

Anna McMorrin:        

 [19675] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps his Department is taking to help prevent delays in the implementation of the 2016 
Columbia peace agreement. 

David Rutley: 
I [Minister Rutley] met with Colombian ministers in Bogota earlier this month where I 
stressed the importance of making progress on the 2016 Peace Agreement. During 
the most recent United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting on 11 January, the 
UK and various Council members reiterated their commitment to support 
implementation of the 2016 peace agreement as the central peace policy in 
Colombia. As the second largest UN Trust Fund donor, the UK continues to be a 
leading advocate in support of Colombia's peace process and supports the work of 
the UN Verification Mission. 

  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office: Legal Costs 

Nick Thomas-Symonds:        

 [19108] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what the 
total cost to the public purse was of legal (a) support and (b) representation to Ministers 
in his Department in relation to their official conduct in each of the last three years. 

David Rutley: 
Such information is not centrally recorded or collated in the form requested. More 
generally, I would refer the hon. Member to the long-standing policies on legal 
expenditure, as set out recently by Cabinet Office Ministers on 12 March 2024, 
Official Report, PQ 17709 and 12 March 2024, Official Report, House of Lords, Cols. 
1901-1904. 

  Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office: Publications 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19725] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, pursuant 
to the Answer of 20 March 2024 to Question 18297 on Foreign, Commonwealth and 
Development Office: Publications, whether the media team monitors DeclassifiedUK. 

David Rutley: 
The media team monitor outlets for any stories relevant to the brief of the FCDO. 

  Gaza: Food Supply 

Dan Carden:        

 [19695] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, with 
reference to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report entitled Famine 
Review Committee: Gaza Strip, published in March 2024, if he will make an assessment 

of the potential implications for his policies of the analysis in that report on the likelihood 
of imminent famine in Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
Palestinians are facing a devastating and growing humanitarian crisis. The UK and 
our partners are stepping up our efforts to get aid in as quickly as possible by land, 
sea and air. 

Israel must take action to allow more aid into Gaza, including scaling up the Jordan 
corridor, opening a crossing in northern Gaza (Karni, Erez or a new crossing point), 
fully opening Ashdod Port for aid delivery and increasing screening capacity at Kerem 
Shalom and Nitzana to seven days a week and extended hours. 

The UK is doing all it can to get as much food into Gaza as possible. We recently 
announced that more than 2,000 tonnes of UK-funded food aid are being distributed 
by the World Food Programme on the ground. This is our largest delivery of aid to 
Gaza in this crisis. This follows 750 tonnes of UK funded food aid arriving in Gaza in 
December, delivered through the World Food Programme, followed by a second 
delivery of 315 tonnes in January.Last month the UK and Jordan also air-dropped 
life-saving food and medicines directly to the Tal Al-Hawa hospital in northern Gaza. 

  Gaza: Health Services 

Emma Hardy:        

 [18771] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
recent steps he has taken to help ensure the safety of health workers in Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister have underlined the need for Israel to 
ensure effective deconfliction in Gaza, and to take all possible measures to ensure 
the safety of medical personnel and facilities. 

We need a humanitarian pause now to allow humanitarian actors and Gazans to 
operate and move safely, and enable hostages to be released. 

We need Israel to ensure effective systems to guarantee the safety of aid convoys, 
humanitarian operations and IDP returns, and facilitate access. 

  Gaza: Humanitarian Aid 

Alan Brown:        

 [19633] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
recent discussions he has had with his Israeli counterpart on Israelâs (a) policy on 
determining what aid is allowed into Gaza and (b) compliance with international 
humanitarian law on the entry of goods for the civilian population in Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have pressed the urgency of getting 
significantly more aid into Gaza to alleviate the desperate situation with Israeli 
counterparts. 

We are calling on Israel to increase access for aid through land routes, scale up the 
Jordan corridor with a streamlined screening and delivery process, open a crossing in 
northern Gaza (Karni, Erez or a new crossing point), fully open Ashdod Port for aid 
delivery and increase screening capacity at Kerem Shalom and Nitzana to seven 
days a week and extended hours. 

  Gaza: Humanitarian Pauses 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18262] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
recent discussions he has had with his US counterpart on the prospect of an immediate 
humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
We engage closely with the US on both this and wider aspects of the conflict. On 13 
March, the UK, US, and regional partners took part in ministerial consultations to 
advance a maritime corridor to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza. On 7 March 
the Foreign Secretary spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and German 
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock about the situation in Gaza. The Foreign 
Secretary also met and raised this with Foreign Ministers of international partner 
countries, including the US, at the Munich Security Conference in February. 

  Gaza: Israel 

Richard Burgon:        

 [19408] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, if he will 
make an assessment of the implications for his policies of the investigation by the UN into 
an Israeli military airstrike on a residential compound in Al Mawasi in Gaza on 18 January 
2024. 

Richard Burgon:        

 [19409] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, whether 
his Department has investigated whether UK arms were used in the Israeli military 
airstrike on a residential compound in Al Mawasi in Gaza on 18 January 2024. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The Foreign Secretary has underlined the need for Israel to ensure effective 
deconfliction in Gaza, and ensure effective systems to guarantee the safety of 
humanitarian operations. It must take all possible measures to ensure the safety of 
medical personnel and facilities. 

We continue to raise this with Israel at the highest levels. 

  Gaza: Ports 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18211] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
discussions he has had with his US counterpart on visa controls at the US temporary sea 
port into Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
I have not discussed the specific issue of visa controls at the planned temporary pier 
with my US counterpart. The UK Government is in regular contact with partners, 
including Cyprus, the US, UAE and others, about a range of operational matters with 
regard to the proposed maritime corridor, including planning efforts to establish the 
temporary pier. 

  Gaza: Ramadan 

Emma Hardy:        

 [18772] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps he is taking to help support (a) civilians and (b) faith groups observe Ramadan in 
Gaza. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The UK is a strong supporter of Freedom of Religion or Belief (FoRB) and calls for 
places of worship to be respected. We want Israel to use all possible measures to 
protect the sanctity of holy sites. We want to see Israel take greater care to limit its 
operations to military targets. 

Palestinian civilians are facing a devastating and growing humanitarian crisis in 
Gaza. We are working with partners to help get aid in as quickly as possible by land, 
sea and air. We also continue to call for an immediate pause to get aid in and 
hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire, without a 
return to destruction, fighting and loss of life. 

  Gibraltar: Economic Situation and Overseas Trade 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18939] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps he is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help (a) support the economy of and (b) 
increase trade between the UK and Gibraltar. 

Leo Docherty: 
The UK is committed to supporting Gibraltar, its people and its economy. We are 
working side-by-side with the Government of Gibraltar to conclude a UK-EU treaty 
which can secure the future prosperity of Gibraltar and the region. We continue to 
collaborate on shared prosperity goals. For example, the UK's Â£500 million Loan 
Guarantee to support Gibraltar's economy was extended in 2023 for a further three 
years and the implementation of the Gibraltar Authorisation Regime will facilitate 
financial services business between the two jurisdictions on a permanent basis. 

  Gibraltar: Spain 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18938] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps his Department is taking to ensure that there is continued mobility across the 
border between Spain and Gibraltar during negotiations with the EU in respect of 
Gibraltar. 

Leo Docherty: 
The UK, working side-by-side with the Government of Gibraltar, is committed to 
concluding a UK-EU treaty as soon as possible. A key objective is to ensure that 
people and goods can move easily between Gibraltar and the surrounding 
communities. Together with the Government of Gibraltar we continue to monitor the 
functioning of the border and raise issues with the Spanish authorities, including at 
Ministerial level, when required. 

  Hamas: UNRWA 

Alan Brown:        

 [19634] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, pursuant 
to the Answer of 1 March 2024 to Question 15935 on Hamas: UNRWA, whether he 
received evidence from (a) the Israeli government, (b) other governments and (c) third 
parties that workers for the UN Relief and Works Agency were (i) complicit and (ii) 
participants in the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October 2023. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The UN Secretary-General has commissioned two independent investigations; one 
by the Office for Internal Oversight Services, and one on UNRWA neutrality policies 
and systems, which is being led by Catherine Colonna. We are following these 
investigations closely. We continue to urge Israel and all parties with relevant 
information to cooperate fully. 

Israel: Travel Information 

Theresa Villiers:        

[R]  [18874] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, if he will 
make it his policy to change the travel advisory guidance on Israel so that areas not 
directly affected by the Gaza conflict are no longer classified as essential travel only. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
Travel advice is constantly under review and regularly updated. How the FCDO 
determines travel advice can be found at the dedicated gov.uk site: 
https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-
advice#how-we-compile-travel-advice 

Specific advice for travelling to Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories can be 
found at the dedicated Gov.uk site: https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel 

 
Israel: West Bank 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18265] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps his Department is taking to help de-escalate tensions in the West Bank; and 
whether he has had discussions with his counterparts in Israel on their (a) withholding of 
work permits and (b) blocking of travel by Palestinians from the West Bank. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The Government maintains a regular dialogue with Israeli counterparts and partners 
on a range of issues relating to the conflict, including steps Israel must take to 
deescalate tensions in the West Bank. This includes halting settlement expansion, 
holding to account those responsible for extremist settler violence and releasing 
frozen funds. 

On 12 February, the UK announced new sanctions against extremist Israeli settlers 
who have violently attacked Palestinians in the West Bank. These sanctions follow 
the announcement by the Foreign Secretary in December that the UK plans to ban 
those responsible for settler violence from entering the UK. 

  Kosovo: Council of Europe 

Dr Matthew Offord:        

 [19325] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, if he will 
make it his policy to support Kosovo becoming a member of the Council of Europe. 

Leo Docherty: 
The UK supports Kosovo's current application to join the Council of Europe. 
Membership of the Council of Europe would bring practical benefits and protections 
for all Kosovo citizens, including minority communities. The Foreign Secretary made 
our support clear during his visit to Kosovo in January this year. 

  Kosovo: Foreign Relations 

Dr Matthew Offord:        

 [19326] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, if he will 
publish a summary of the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and 
Development Affairs' recent visit to Kosovo. 

Leo Docherty: 
The Foreign Secretary reflected on his recent visit to Kosovo at the Foreign Affairs 
Committee session on 9 January (https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/44138eb7-
41b6-47eb-9c61-e9ac76acc233), sharing his views on the severity of the attack in 
Banjska in September 2023 and the need for the West to ensure its approach to the 
Western Balkans fully accounts for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Government 
issued a press release in advance of his visit 
(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-to-visit-kosovo-to-underline-
uk-support), and the Foreign Secretary himself gave an overview of his meeting with 

 
UK troops deployed to Kosovo as part of NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR) during the 
visit (https://twitter.com/FCDOGovUK/status/1742992750079770754?s=20). 

  Kosovo: Recognition of States 

Dr Matthew Offord:        

 [19324] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
diplomatic steps his Department is taking to encourage European Union nations to 
recognise Kosovo as an independent sovereign state. 

Leo Docherty: 
We welcome the fact that the vast majority of EU members states recognise Kosovo's 
statehood. In line with our longstanding support for Kosovo's international integration 
as a sovereign independent state, the UK continues to use suitable opportunities to 
reinforce the case for recognition with the five remaining EU members states which 
have yet to recognise Kosovo's statehood. 

  Ludivia Galindez 

Anna McMorrin:        

 [19676] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of reports of the murder of 
womenâs rights and peace activist Ludivia Galindez in Colombia on 23 February 2024. 

David Rutley: 
Colombia is a Human Rights Priority Country for the UK and the British Government 
remains concerned at the worrying rate of murders of, and threats against, human 
rights defenders and social leaders in Colombia. We will continue to support the 
Colombian Government in its commitment to implement the 2016 Peace Agreement 
and ensure the protection and safety of peace activists and women's rights 
campaigners. During my visit to Colombia earlier this month, I [Minister Rutley] raised 
the human rights situation with Vice Foreign Minister Coy. At the UN Security Council 
on 11 January, we set out our concern over attacks on human rights defenders, 
communities, women and social leaders, and reiterated our commitment to 
supporting efforts to tackle the root causes of violence in Colombia. 

  Nagorno Karabakh: Churches and Cultural Heritage 

Andrew Bridgen:        

 [19361] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
discussions he has had with his counterpart in Azerbaijan on the (a) condition and (b) 
security of Armenian Christian (i) churches and (ii) other heritage sites in Nagorno-
Karabakh. 

Leo Docherty: 
The UK Government is clear that the preservation of religious and cultural sites in the 
region is an important issue and we take seriously reports of the destruction of 
churches or other sites of religious significance. We are aware of allegations from 

both Armenia and Azerbaijan that cultural and religious sites have been deliberately 
damaged over the course of the conflict. UK Ministers and the British Embassy in 
Baku have raised the topic of religious and cultural destruction with the Azerbaijani 
government consistently and at the most senior levels. 

  Nagorno Karabakh: Cultural Heritage 

Andrew Bridgen:        

 [19618] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, if he will 
hold discussions with his Armenian counterpart on the protection of Armenian Christian 
cultural heritage sites in Nagorno-Karabakh; and whether he has made an assessment of 
the potential implications for his policies of the inclusion of Nagorno-Karabakh in Open 
Door UKâs World Watch List, published on17 January 2024. 

Leo Docherty: 
We are clear that the preservation of religious and cultural sites in the region is an 
important issue and we take seriously reports of the destruction of churches and 
other sites of religious significance in both Armenia and Azerbaijan as a result of their 
long-running conflict. Ministers and the British Embassies in Yerevan and Baku have 
raised the need to protect such sites with the Armenian and Azerbaijani Governments 
consistently and at the most senior levels. Open Door UK's World Watch List 
provides a sobering account of the extreme difficulties faced by many Christians 
around the world. We note the report's comments regarding Azerbaijan and regularly 
raise human rights issues with the Azerbaijani Government. 

  Nagorno Karabakh: Refugees 

Andrew Bridgen:        

 [19362] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, whether 
his Department is taking diplomatic steps to help ensure the right of return to Nagorno-
Karabakh of Christian Armenians. 

Leo Docherty: 
The UK Government is clear that Azerbaijan must create the conditions for a safe 
and secure return of ethnic Armenians who were displaced during September's 
military operation and want to return. We welcomed Azerbaijan's provision of a 
registration portal, though more work is needed to assist those considering a return. 
Ministers and officials have discussed these issues with the Azerbaijani Government 
and encourage Azerbaijan to be proactive in enabling the return of those who wish to 
do so. 

  Nigeria: Pollution Control 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [18877] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, pursuant 
to the Answer of 29 February 2024 to Question 15265 on Shell: Nigeria, what steps his 

Department is taking to support the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project; and 
whether his Department has provided any financial support to the project. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
HMG does not provide direct financial support to the Hydrocarbon Pollution 
Remediation Project (HYPREP). We have previously made recommendations to 
HYPREP around improved governance and transparency. Officials have encouraged 
HYPREP to ensure it is thorough, well managed and delivers for local communities. 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [18878] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, pursuant 
to the Answer of 29 February 2024 to Question 15265 on Shell: Nigeria, what initiatives 
his Department is supporting to help tackle oil pollution in the Niger Delta in areas not 
covered by the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The UK continues to encourage a coordinated effort between the Nigerian 
Government, oil and gas companies, and communities to bring an end to all forms of 
oil contamination in Nigeria. The UK has also supported Nigeria to improve their 
ability to monitor greenhouse gas emissions, including with use of satellite data, and 
to strengthen the regulations governing oil and gas facilities and infrastructure that 
will help reduce emissions. The UK government is supporting Nigeria in meeting its 
ambitious climate change objectives set by its Nationally Determined Contributions 
and commitment to net-zero by 2060. 

  Nuclear Disarmament 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [18558] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
steps he is taking with international partners (a) through the UN and (b) in other fora to (i) 
tackle the use of nuclear rhetoric and (ii) promote disarmament. 

Leo Docherty: 
Alongside our NATO Allies and G7 partners, we have consistently condemned 
Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric. In February 2024, G7 Foreign Ministers 
"condemned Russia's irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, its posture of strategic 
intimidation, its announcement that it has deployed nuclear weapons in Belarus, at an 
increasingly unstable and dangerous moment, and its undermining of arms control 
regimes". Our nuclear deterrent has protected the UK and our Allies from the most 
extreme acts of aggression and will continue to protect us for as long as it is needed. 
We remain committed to full implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons (NPT). 

In 2023 G7 Leaders issued the Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, which 
reaffirms our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with 
undiminished security for all. The UK has also funded over Â£1.8 million worth of 
projects on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, including our annual 
conference to address the diplomatic, political and strategic challenges for the global 

non-proliferation regime. This sits alongside our work on verification and irreversibility 
of nuclear disarmament that uniquely connects key government representatives with 
non-government policy, scientific and technical experts. 

  Peru: Forests 

Alex Sobel:        

 [19165] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
discussions he has had with his Peruvian counterpart on the potential impact of that 
country's Forestry Law on (a) deforestation and (b) human rights. 

David Rutley: 
I [Minister Rutley] visited Peru in October 2023 and held discussions with senior 
representatives of the Peruvian Government on a range of priorities, such as the 
importance of protecting human rights and the environment. We are working with the 
Peruvian Government to drive sustainable development that protects human rights 
and delivers climate objectives. Our Embassy in Lima has regularly discussed with 
the Peruvian Government the potential impacts of changes to the Forestry and 
Wildlife Law and raised concerns about how these could affect achievement of Peru's 
international commitments. 

  South Sudan and Sudan: Oil 

Ms Lyn Brown:        

 [19578] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
assessment he has made of the impact of the halting of oil exports from South Sudan via 
Sudan on (a) security and the humanitarian situation in South Sudan and (b) prospects 
for (i) escalation and (ii) de-escalation of the conflict in Sudan; and whether he is taking 
steps to engage (A) other countries affected and (B) China in discussion of the potential 
impact of the halting of such oil exports. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
There has been recent damage to the oil pipeline that carries oil from South Sudan to 
Sudan, which has significantly reduced the South Sudanese government's oil 
production capabilities and subsequently their income. This economic deterioration is 
exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation in South Sudan, as food prices 
and the cost of humanitarian assistance delivery have increased. We are continuing 
to monitor the impacts of this closely, including on the security and humanitarian 
situation in both Sudan and South Sudan. 

  UNRWA: Finance 

Steve McCabe:        

 [18833] 

To ask the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, what 
funds his Department contributed to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in each of the last five years. 

Mr Andrew Mitchell: 
The UK provided the following funding to UNRWA in each of the last five financial 
years: 

FY 2019 - 20: Â£65.5 million 

FY 2020 - 21: Â£65 million 

FY 2021 - 22: Â£11 million 

FY 2022 - 23: Â£18.7 million 

FY 2023 - 24: Â£35 million 

The UK provided Â£35 million to UNRWA this financial year, including an uplift of Â£16 
million for the Gaza humanitarian response, all of which was disbursed before the 
recent allegations came to light. No more British funding is due this financial year. We 
are pausing any future funding of UNRWA. 

  HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE 

  Autism: Children 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18916] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many children are waiting 
for (a) an assessment and (b) a diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The latest autism assessment waiting times data drawn from the Mental Health 
Services Dataset was published on 14 March 2024. This data showed that the 
number of people aged zero to 17 years old with an open referral for suspected 
autism was 102,024 in December 2023. The data also showed that, in December 
2023, 6.3% of patients, or 5,443 patients, aged zero to 17 years old received a first 
contact appointment within 13 weeks. 

Data on children and young people in this dataset is expected to be an 
underestimate. Caution should be used when interpreting these statistics since they 
are experimental rather than official statistics. The majority of children assessed for 
autism in the United Kingdom are seen in child development services, which are out 
of the scope of this dataset. This means the published figures will underestimate the 
volume of referrals or diagnoses and the associated impact on health services. NHS 
England continue to conduct exploratory analysis into the Community Services 
Dataset, with a view to include autism waiting times data from this dataset. This 
should improve the coverage of this data. 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18917] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps her Department is 
taking to help reduce waiting times for autism spectrum disorder assessments for 
children. 

Maria Caulfield: 
We expect integrated care boards (ICBs) to have due regard to National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on autism, when commissioning 
services. It is the responsibility of ICBs to make available appropriate provision to 
meet the health and care needs of their local population, in line with these NICE 
guidelines. 

In 2023 NHS England published a national framework and operational guidance for 
all age autism diagnostic assessment services. This guidance will help the National 
Health Service improve all age autism assessment services and improve the 
experience for people referred to an autism assessment service. 

We have invested in improving autism assessment services over recent years, 
including Â£2.5 million in 2022/23 to support local areas with improvements in autism 
assessment pathways. For 2023/2024, Â£4.2 million of funding is available across 
England to improve services for autistic children and young people, including autism 
assessment services. 

NHS England publishes quarterly data on how many people are waiting for an autism 
assessment and for how long. While these are experimental statistics, the data does 
provide useful information nationally and locally, to support local areas in improving 
their performance and reducing assessment waiting times. 

Each ICB in England is expected to have an Executive Lead for learning disability 
and autism, supporting the board in planning to meet the needs of its local population 
of people with a learning disability and autism, including in relation to appropriate 
autism assessment pathways. NHS England has published guidance on these roles. 

  Autism: Diagnosis 

Daisy Cooper:        

 [18945] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if she will make an assessment 
of the potential impact of average waiting times for autism assessments on other health 
and care services. 

Maria Caulfield: 
There are no current plans to make this specific assessment. We recognise the 
importance of early identification of autism so that an individualâs needs can be 
identified sooner, and support put in place earlier in life. 

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceâs (NICE) guidelines on autism 
highlight the importance of conducting an autism assessment as soon as possible so 
that appropriate health and social care interventions, and advice and support, can be 
offered. It is the responsibility of integrated care boards (ICBs) to make available 
appropriate provision to meet the health and care needs of their local population, in 
line with the NICEâs guidelines. 

In April 2023, NHS England published a national framework and operational guidance 
for autism assessment services. This guidance will help the National Health Service 

to deliver improved outcomes for children, young people, and adults. The operational 
guidance makes it clear that people should be able to access support and care from 
other services for needs that appear linked to physical and mental health, including 
while they are waiting for an autism assessment. This year, the Department is 
updating the Statutory Guidance on Autism to support the NHS and local authorities 
in delivering improved outcomes for autistic people. 

  Blood: Contamination 

Dame Andrea Jenkyns:        

 [19113] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what estimate her Department 
has made of the number of people who have died since being (a) treated with 
contaminated blood products and (b) given contaminated blood transfusions in Morley 
and Outwood constituency. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The Department has not made an estimate of the number of people who have died 
since being treated with contaminated blood products and given contaminated blood 
transfusions, in the Morley and Outwood constituency. 

Dame Andrea Jenkyns:        

 [19114] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what psychological support is 
available for people (a) infected and (b) affected by contaminated blood and blood 
products in Morley and Outwood constituency. 

Maria Caulfield: 
Psychological support is available for those who are beneficiaries of the England 
Infected Blood Support Scheme (EIBSS), and their families. The EIBSS provides a 
grant of up to Â£900 a year for beneficiaries and family members to access 
counselling, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approved talking 
therapies. In August 2022, this offer was expanded to enable beneficiaries to access 
funding for ongoing and longer-term treatment. Further information is available at the 
following link: 

https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/talking-therapy-support 

A bespoke psychological support service for infected blood victims, commissioned by 
NHS England, is currently being developed, intended to go live in early Summer 
2024. 

  Cancer: Children and Young People 

Helen Morgan:        

 [19747] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whether she is taking steps to 
help ensure that healthcare providers inform the carers of children and young people with 
cancer of the financial support available to them. 

Andrew Stephenson: 
NHS England and the integrated care boards are responsible for commissioning and 
ensuring the healthcare needs of local communities in England are met. This includes 
taking steps to ensure that healthcare providers inform all patients and carers, 
including the carers of children and young people with cancer, of the financial support 
available to them. 

The National Health Service in England runs schemes to provide financial assistance 
for travel to a hospital or other NHS premises, for specialist NHS treatment or 
diagnostics tests, when referred by a doctor or other primary healthcare professional. 

  Care Workers: Visas 

Andrew Gwynne:        

 [19011] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what recent assessment she 
has made of the potential impact of the removal of (a) overseas and (b) senior care 
workersâ rights to bring dependants on main applicant flows for the health and social care 
visa. 

Helen Whately: 
We expect social care visa volumes will remain resilient to removing the eligibility for 
new care and senior care workers to bring dependants. This is in the context of a 
strong global labour supply, possible changes in migrant behaviour in response, and 
that a proportion of recruits are estimated to already come without dependants. The 
Home Office has published estimates of the impact these changes might have on the 
number of people applying to work in the sector from outside the United Kingdom, 
which are available at the following link:

  Congenital Abnormalities: Health Services 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [19400] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps she is taking to 
ensure effective collaboration between early intervention services for babies with 
neurodevelopmental conditions. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
The Healthy Child Programme is the national public prevention and early intervention 
health framework for babies, children, and young people. Health visitors areâ¯specialist 
community public health nursesâ¯who lead the Healthy Child Programme from 
preconception to five years old. They deliver evidence-based interventions, which 
include five mandated reviews: antenatal; approximately two weeks after birth; six to 
eight weeks after birth; at one years old; and at two to two and a half years old. 
These include reviews of development and growth. Where a baby or child has special 
education needs or vulnerabilities, health visitors work in partnership with other 
professionals and families, to respond to health and care needs. 

The Government is also investing approximately Â£300 million to improve support for 
families though the Family Hubs and Start for Life programme. The programme is 
implementing many elements of the Governmentâs Best Start for Life Vision which 
was published in March 2021, and is delivering a step change in outcomes for 
babies, children, and their parents and carers in 75 local authorities in England, 
including those with high levels of deprivation. Many local authorities without funding 
have also chosen to implement elements of the vision. 

Family hubs offer support to families from conception to two years old, and provide 
services for children of all ages, from zero to 19 years old, or zero to 25 years old for 
families with children who have special educational needs and disabilities. Family 
hubs are a way of joining up locally to improve access to services, the connections 
between families, professionals, services, and providers, and prioritise strengthening 
the relationships that carry us all through life. They bring together services for 
children of all ages, with a great Start for Life offer at their core. 

  Dental Services 

Dr ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey:        

 [19343] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, pursuant to the Answer of 5 
March 2024 to Question 16340 on Dental Services, whether column H in the spreadsheet 
link provided is the (a) monthly or (b) annual unit of dental activity performance target. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
The answer of 5 March 2024 to Question 16340 provided a link to data published by 
the NHS Business Services Authority on English Contractor Monthly General Dental 
Activity. Column H of the data spreadsheet is the annual Units of Dental Activity 
performance target. 

Preet Kaur Gill:        

 [19421] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if she will publish the modelling 
produced by NHS England which shows that the NHS Dental Recovery Plan will deliver 
2.5 million NHS dentistry appointments. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
On 7 February 2024, we published Faster, simpler and fairer: our plan to recover and 
reform NHS dentistry, which is backed by Â£200 million and will fund approximately 
2.5 million additional appointments, or more than 1.5 million additional courses of 
dental treatment. The plan sets out our actions to improve dental access for patients 
by helping the sector to recover from the pandemic, as well as actions needed for 
long-term reform. 

Further information on the modelling for the number of additional appointments being 
delivered under the plan will be shared with the Health and Social Care Select 
Committee shortly, and also to be placed in the Library. 

  Dental Services: Wellingborough 

Gen Kitchen:        

 [19755] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what assessment he has made 
of the adequacy of provision of NHS dentists in Wellingborough constituency. 

Gen Kitchen:        

 [19756] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what recent assessment she 
has made of the adequacy of NHS dental provision in Wellingborough constituency. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
On 7 February 2024, we published Faster, simpler and fairer: our plan to recover and 
reform NHS dentistry, which is backed by Â£200 million and will fund approximately 
2.5 million additional appointments, or more than 1.5 million additional courses of 
dental treatment. The plan sets out our actions to improve dental access for patients 
across the country and to address the challenges facing National Health Service 
dentistry, including in Northamptonshire. 

From 1 April 2023, the responsibility for commissioning primary care dentistry to meet 
the needs of the local population has been delegated to all integrated care boards 
(ICBs) across England. Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board is responsible for 
having local processes in place to identify areas of need and determine the priorities 
for investment across the ICB area. NHS Dental Statistics, published by NHS Digital, 
provides data on dental activity in England. The latest annual report is available at the 
following link:

  Department of Health and Social Care: Written Questions 

Navendu Mishra:        

 [19733] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, when she plans to provide an 
Answer to Question 17965 tabled by the hon. Member for Stockport on 11 March 2024. 

Andrew Stephenson: 
I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to Question 17965 on 21 March 2024. 

  Disease Control 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19147] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what assessment his 
Department has made of the impact of ending government support for the UK Recovery 
programme on the UK's preparedness for future pandemics. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and UK Research and 
Innovation (UKRI) funded the RECOVERY trial in March 2020, initially for 18 months, 
before progressively extending the study to March 2024. It was a highly successful 
trial that, by recruiting patients at a faster rate than any previous trial, was able to 

rapidly identify the first drugs that reduce COVID-19 mortality. At the end of an NIHR 
award, including any extensions, researchers can apply through a competitive 
process for new funding. 

The NIHR continues to fund research into infectious diseases, which could be utilised 
in the event of another pandemic. For example, the NIHR has allocated Â£2.9 million 
to Imperial College London and Imperial Healthcare NHS Trust to adapt their COVID-
19 trial for severe flu patients. The NIHR is open to applications on any health and 
care-related topic. 

More widely, the UK Biological Security Strategy, published in June 2023, reaffirms 
our ambition to scale up discovery, development, and manufacturing of therapeutics 
and vaccines within 100 days of a pandemic being declared. This aligns with our 
ongoing work to ensure a flexible and capabilities-based approach to pandemic 
preparedness, which will see emergency planners develop and maintain a generic 
suite of adaptable response capabilities across the Government. This will enable an 
approach that can be flexibly deployed to meet the demands of any future pandemic, 
and support a whole-system response. 

  Disease Control: Staff 

Chi Onwurah:        

 [17599] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many full-time equivalent 
members of staff work on pandemic preparedness in (a) her Department and (b) the UK 
Health Security Agency. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The Government continues to plan and prepare for a range of pandemic and 
emerging infectious disease scenarios, including those caused by respiratory contact, 
both influenza and non-influenza, and vector-borne pathogens, building on lessons 
learned from exercises and incidents, including the COVID-19 pandemic. There are 
currently 21.35 full time equivalent (FTE) staff working on pandemic preparedness 
within the Global and Public Health Group of the Department. 

Every team across the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is playing a 
critical role in the nationâs pandemic preparedness and is committing significant 
resource and effort to meet our remit. As a result, it is not possible to provide an FTE 
figure of all staff whose work forms part of pandemic preparedness. The UKHSAâs 
Centre for Pandemic Preparedness (CPP) holds some members of staff who are 
focused primarily on pandemic preparedness policy and coordination. There currently 
are 18.4 FTEs working in CPP. 

  Food: Labelling 

Sir Christopher Chope:        

 [19237] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps her Department is 
taking to help ensure retail food businesses comply with measures in the Food 
Information Regulations 2014 on providing written allergen information for labels. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is responsible for food safety related labelling, 
including allergens. Local authorities are responsible for enforcing food law in the 
vast majority of food businesses, including those in the retail and catering sector. As 
central competent authority, the FSA monitors the delivery of official controls by local 
authorities. 

The FSA produces the statutory Food Law Code of Practice and associated Practice 
Guidance establishing a set of expectations for the activities local authorities are 
responsible for under food law, and how these are to be delivered. This is supported 
by a range of training, advice, and guidance to help food officers discharge their 
functions. Recent changes to the Food Law Code of Practice will enable a more risk-
based and intelligence-driven approach to targeting premises for food standards 
inspections and carrying out interventions, and includes specific consideration of the 
risk factor for compliance with providing allergen information. 

The FSA also provides support for food businesses, for example through guidance 
and training, on providing allergen information in line with the requirements of the 
2014 Food Information to Consumer Regulations to help drive up compliance and 
make it easier for people with a food allergy, intolerance, and coeliac disease to 
make safe choices when eating out. 

  Gender Dysphoria: Children 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18647] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many children in England 
have been issued puberty blockers since 2019. 

Maria Caulfield: 
We have always been clear that childrenâs safety and well-being is paramount, so we 
welcomed NHS Englandâs landmark decision to ban routine use puberty blockers to 
children experiencing gender dysphoria. This decision was based on the available 
evidence and expert clinical opinion. 

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or puberty blockers are used to treat 
several medical conditions in children and young people. These can include 
precocious puberty, some forms of cancer, endometriosis, and gender dysphoria. 

Information on the clinical indication for which these medications have been 
prescribed is not held centrally. The following table shows the number of identifiable 
patients prescribed and dispensed gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for all 
purposes, in primary and secondary care in England from 2019 to September 2022:

  Health Services: Full Sutton Prison 

Sir Greg Knight:        

 [19003] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many requests for 
healthcare treatment for prisoners at HMP Full Sutton were made in each of the last five 
years; and what recent assessment she has made of the adequacy of healthcare 
treatment for prisoners at that prison. 

Maria Caulfield: 
Information on the number of individual requests for healthcare services for prisoners 
at HMP Full Sutton is not collected centrally. Healthcare services for the prison 
population at HMP Full Sutton are commissioned by NHS England, to ensure they 
are of an equivalent quality and standard to National Health Service care and 
treatment provided in the community. The range of services available to all 600 male 
prisoners at the facility includes general practitioner services, dental services, 
ophthalmic services, mental health services, and public health services, including 
substance misuse services. 

The frequency and capacity of healthcare sessions commissioned at HMP Full Sutton 
is informed by the contracting and performance management process. Quarterly 
quality and performance reports are provided to commissioners, highlighting any 
service pressures and actions being taken to address workforce or access issues. 
New provider contracts will come into effect from 1 June 2024, with services being 
further strengthened to meet the needs of the prisoner population. 

  Health Services: Veterans 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19522] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many veterans in garrison 
towns have used Op Courage since its inception. 

 
Steve McCabe:        

 [19523] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, pursuant to the answer of 15 
March 2024 to Question 17714 on Health Services: Veterans, how many veterans used 
Op Restore services in 2022 and 2023. 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19524] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, pursuant to the answer of 15 
March 2024 to Question 17714 on Health Services: Veterans, how many veterans in the 
West Midlands used Op Restore services in 2022 and 2023. 

Maria Caulfield: 
Data on Op COURAGE is collated by the integrated care board where a patient is 
registered. Between 2017 and December 2023, there have been 22,371 referrals to 
Op COURAGE for veterans who are registered with a general practice, located in 
areas with military presence. In 2022 and 2023, there were 581 referrals for Op 
RESTORE. 78 of these were from the Midlands region. Data was collated at a 
regional level only, and is not available for West Midlands. 

  Health Services: Women 

Anneliese Dodds:        

 [18793] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many womenâs health 
hubs were open on 29 February 2024. 

Anneliese Dodds:        

 [18794] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what recent assessment she 
has made of the adequacy of the number of womenâs health hubs open on 29 February 
2024. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The expansion of womenâs health hubs is a priority ambition within the Womenâs 
Health Strategy for England. In October 2022 the Birmingham, RAND and Cambridge 
Evaluation (BRACE) Centreâs early evaluation of womenâs health hubs identified 13 
women's health hubs in England. This evaluation is available at the following link: 

https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-social-sciences/social-
policy/brace/whh-interim-summary-paper-final.pdf 

We are investing Â£25 million into womenâs health hubs to enable the establishment of 
at least one womenâs health hub in every integrated care system. The funding is 
being distributed to every integrated care board (ICB), with each ICB receiving 
Â£595,000 in total over two years, 2023/24 and 2024/25. ICB plans received in 
September 2023 indicate that the funding is supporting at least 49 womenâs health 
hubs, which includes the creation of 38 new hubs and the expansion of 11 existing 
hub models. This funding is intended to show proof of concept to enable ICBs to 
assess the benefit of hubs and roll out more widely. 

  Healthy Start Scheme 

Mrs Emma Lewell-Buck:        

 [19623] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if she will have discussions with 
the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions on the potential merits of automatically 
enrolling eligible people in the Healthy Start scheme. 

Andrea Leadsom: 
There are no plans for specific discussions on this point. The NHS Business Services 
Authority operates the Healthy Start scheme on behalf of the Department. The 
Healthy Start scheme has recently transitioned from paper vouchers to a prepaid 
card. All applicants to the Healthy Start scheme, where they meet the eligibility 
criteria set out in the Healthy Start legislation, must accept the terms and conditions 
of the prepaid card at the point of application. As the prepaid card is a financial 
product and cannot be issued without the applicant accepting these terms, the NHS 
Business Services Authority is not able to automatically provide eligible families with 
a prepaid card. 

Intensive Care: Disease Control 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [19398] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what assessment she has 
made of the preparedness of intensive care services for a future pandemic. 

Maria Caulfield: 
The Department continues to plan and prepare for a range of pandemic and 
emerging infectious disease scenarios, including those caused by respiratory contact, 
both influenza and non-influenza, and vector-borne pathogens, building on lessons 
learned from exercises and incidents, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
Department working with health and care partners is strengthening pandemic 
preparedness by considering the flexible and scalable response capabilities that can 
be adapted to any threat that the health and social care system needs. 

This includes intensive care capacity that will continue to be an integral part of 
National Health Service resilience and pandemic planning. The urgent and 
emergency care recovery plan this year sought to strengthen capacity within the 
acute bed base, with 5,000 additional permanent staffed core general and acute beds 
delivered, compared to planned 2022/23 levels. Our preparedness also includes 
considering the medicines and other supporting products for intensive care services 
in a pandemic. 

Isebrook Hospital 

Gen Kitchen:        

 [19757] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whether she has made an 
assessment of the potential merits of introducing an urgent care centre at Isebrook 
Hospital in Wellingborough constituency. 

 
 
Helen Whately: 
The commissioning of local health services is a matter for local National Health 
Service commissioners and providers. The Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board 
has no current plans to develop an urgent care centre at Isebrook Hospital. 

  Mental Health Services: Veterans 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19247] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many veterans with OCD 
have used Op COURAGE since its inception. 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19248] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, how many veterans with drug 
and alcohol addictions have used Op COURAGE since its inception. 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19249] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whether bespoke wellbeing 
support is provided by the NHS to veterans who are full-time carers. 

Maria Caulfield: 
Prior to April 2023, Op COURAGE was formed from the three separate services of 
the Transition, Intervention and Liaison service, the Complex Treatment Service, and 
the High Intensity Service. Performance data for these services did not collect 
uniquely identifiable information on individual veterans, so it would not be possible to 
identify instances where a veteran had attended Op COURAGE for more than one 
course of treatment. 

No data is held on the numbers of veterans with gambling additions that have used 
Op COURAGE. Data analysed includes the primary mental health reason for referral 
to Op COURAGE. From April 2023, there have been no referrals to Op COURAGE 
with a primary mental health reason of gambling addiction. Since April 2023, less 
than 1.5% of referrals to Op COURAGE have been with a primary mental health 
reason of either obsessive-compulsive disorder or drug or alcohol difficulties. 

Between August 2021 and September 2024, Â£339,000 has been allocated across the 
three social prescribing pilot projects which are in Cornwall, Durham, and Dorset. The 
National Health Service provides wellbeing support to all full-time carers. Veterans 
who identify as a carer are offered a Carerâs Assessment, which is undertaken by 
local authorities. The outcome of the Carerâs Assessment will inform a care and 
support plan, which is bespoke to the needs of the carer. 

The Better Care Fund in 2023/24 includes Â£327 million for carers support, including 
short breaks and respite services for carers. It also funds advice and support to 
carers and a small number of additional local authority duties. There is no data on 
how much of that funding may have been used for veterans. 

  Mental Health: Debt Collection 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19140] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, whether her Department has 
made an assessment of the potential impact of debt collection practices on the (a) mental 
and (b) physical health of individuals in financial difficulty. 

Maria Caulfield: 
No specific assessment has been made, but we work with HM Treasury to support 
people with mental ill health facing debt collection. We have been working with HM 
Treasury and the Money and Pensions Service to promote the mental health 
Breathing Space scheme, which gives those with mental ill health who are facing 
financial difficulties, the space to receive debt advice without pressure from creditors 
or mounting debts. The scheme has protected over 100,000 people who are unable 
to afford their debt repayments by pausing enforcement action, creditor contact and 
most interest, fees, and charges for a 60-day period, giving them time to find a debt 
solution that works for them. 

Those receiving mental health crisis treatment can also access a Mental Health Crisis 
Breathing Space, where the protections last as long as their mental health crisis 
treatment lasts, plus a further 30 days. 

The Government is also delivering a package of cost-of-living support totalling over 
Â£104 billion, or Â£3,700 per household on average, between 2022 to 2025. The 
Government is continuing to support millions of households most in need, with up to 
Â£900 in further cost of living payments in the past year. 

Over six million people across the United Kingdom on eligible extra-costs disability 
benefits have received a Â£150 Disability Cost of Living Payment, to help with the 
additional costs they face. More than eight million pensioner households across the 
UK have received an additional Â£300 Cost of Living Payment during the winter of 
2023/24, paid as a top-up to the winter fuel payment. 

  Social Services: Pay 

Matt Warman:        

 [14881] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if she will make an estimate of 
the cost to (a) the public purse and (b) social care providers of increasing pay for staff in 
the social care sector by 65p per hour. 

Helen Whately: 
The Department has previously estimated that the cost to the public purse of raising 
minimum pay in adult social care to the National Living Wage plus 65p is 
approximately Â£600 million per year. This includes direct care staff only and excludes 
ancillary staff. 

This estimate does not include the additional costs of higher pay which would be 
borne by the group of at least 221,000 âself-fundersâ in care homes and using 
community care who pay for their own care. 

  Social Services: South Holland and the Deepings 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18837] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, what steps she is taking to 
increase adult social care capacity in South Holland and the Deepings constituency. 

Helen Whately: 
The Government has made up to Â£8.6 billion available in additional funding over this 
financial year and next, to support adult social care and discharge. This includes 
nearly Â£2 billion being made available to local authorities over two years through the 
Market Sustainability and Improvement Fund, which is specifically designed to 
support increased adult social care capacity. Local authorities can choose to use the 
funding to increase fee rates paid to adult social care providers, increase adult social 
care workforce capacity and retention, and reduce adult social care waiting times. 
Lincolnshire County Council received a total of just over Â£13 million through this fund 
in 2023/24, and are set to receive nearly Â£15 million in 2024/25. This is in addition to 
the broader funding that is available to Lincolnshire to spend on adult social care.

 [19575] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, on (a) how many occasions and 
(b) which dates (i) he and (ii) Ministers in his Department have visited Brook House 
Immigration Removal Centre since 9 September 2017. 

Michael Tomlinson: 
Brook House Immigration Removal Centre has been visited by four Home Office 
Ministers from 2018-24. 

18 January 2018 â Immigration Minister 

30 June 2022 â Lords Minister of State 

28 August 2022 â Minister for Illegal Migration 

5 February 2024 â Minister for Countering Illegal Migration 

  Crime: Pharmacy 

Rachael Maskell:        

 [18906] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what information his Department 
holds on the most common crimes that take place at community pharmacies. 

Chris Philp: 
The Home Office holds data on the number of offences recorded by the police in 
England and Wales, and collects and publishes data on crime affecting commercial 
business premises, including retail premises, in England and Wales as part of the 
Commercial Victimisation Survey. 

Neither data source provides the level of detail necessary to identify crimes that take 
place in community pharmacies. 

The Commercial Victimisation Survey provides the most reliable estimate of crime 
impacting wholesale and retail premises in England and Wales. The most recent 
available data, for the year 2022, is available online: 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/crime-against-businesses-findings-from-the-
2022-commercial-victimisation-survey. 

The National Business Crime Centre has published guidance containing practical 
advice to help pharmacies identify risks and prevent crime, the guidance is published 
here: Pharmacies October 22.pdf (nbcc.police.uk). 

  Fire and Rescue Services 

Dame Diana Johnson:        

 [19572] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, on (a) how many occasions and 
(b) what dates he has intervened in a fire and rescue authority under section 22 of the 
Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 since 2010. 

Chris Philp: 
Fire policy transferred from the Department for Communities and Local Government 
to the Home Office on 5 January 2016. Since then, there have been no formal 
interventions in the operations of a fire and rescue authority by the Secretary of State 
in England under section 22 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004. We do not 
hold any information for the period prior to the machinery of government changes. 

Dame Diana Johnson:        

 [19574] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, whether he has made an 
assessment of the potential merits of updating the Fire and Rescue National Framework 
for England. 

Chris Philp: 
We are revising the Fire National Framework for England to embed the reforms set 
out in the Government Response to the White Paper. The Framework sets priorities 
and objectives for Fire and Rescue Authorities in England in connection with the 
discharge of their functions. We are engaging partners to shape our proposals and 
key themes. 

We intend to launch a public consultation on the revisions later this year. 

  Fire and Rescue Services: Staff 

Dame Diana Johnson:        

 [19573] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, how many times since 26 
October 2022 the Minister for Crime, Policing and Fire has met (a) current and (b) former 
firefighters who have experienced bullying, discrimination or sexual harassment at work. 

Chris Philp: 
The Minister for Crime, Policing and Fire has prioritised engagement with the sector 
on integrity matters. This has included Chief Fire Officers, Fire and Rescue Authority 
Chairs, His Majestyâs Inspectorate, the National Fire Chiefs Council, the Local 
Government Association and representative groups such as the Fire Brigades Union. 
In addition to regularly meeting frontline firefighters and police officers when visiting 
fire and police stations. 

He will continue to meet with sector leaders to hear first-hand on these issues. 

The Minister for Crime, Policing and Fire has corresponded with both current and 
former staff in fire and rescue services, who have raised concerns regarding bullying, 
harassment, and discrimination. 

The Home Office will continue to call for action to ensure fire and rescue services are 
welcoming, respectful workplaces that enable all individuals who work in them to 
thrive. 

  Fire Prevention: Departmental Coordination 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19041] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps he is taking to 
coordinate activity across Government in order to improve the UKâs preparedness for 
extreme wildfire events. 

Chris Philp: 
The Home Office are the lead Government Department for Wildfire Response and 
own the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA) wildfire risk. 

This Wildfire Framework outlines the work being undertaken to improve the UKâs 
preparedness for wildfires in England. The Home Office works closely with other 
departments and key stakeholders including Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs and the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities to 
mitigate the risk of wildfire. 

The Home Office have committed to scoping a wildfire strategy and action plan by 
mid 2024, with support from Defra and its agencies. This commitment is outlined in 
the third National Adaptation Plan. 

The Home Office maintains regular engagement with National Bodies including the 
National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to monitor and 
review sector led improvements to wildfire response and mitigation. 

  Fire Regulations: Holiday Accommodation 

Derek Thomas:        

 [18914] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment his 
Department has made of the adequacy of (a) compliance with fire regulations by 
providers of small paying guest accommodation and (b) the numbers of fire assessors to 
ensure that compliance. 

Chris Philp: 
The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (FSO) is the main piece of fire 
safety legislation that applies to all non-domestic premises in England and Wales. 
The FSO places a legal duty on Responsible Persons (RPs) to undertake a fire risk 
assessment and put in place a suitable set of fire safety precautions to ensure the 
safety of those who use the premises. 

Fire and Rescue Authorities are the main enforcement body for the FSO. Each FRA 
is required to deliver an independent annual risk-based inspection programme to 
check the compliance of premises in their area. 

  Home Office: Legal Costs 

Nick Thomas-Symonds:        

 [19110] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what the total cost to the public 
purse was of legal (a) support and (b) representation to Ministers in his Department in 
relation to their official conduct in each of the last three years. 

Chris Philp: 
Such information is not centrally recorded or collated in the form requested. More 
generally, I would refer the honourable Member to the long-standing policies on legal 
expenditure, as set out recently by Cabinet Office Ministers on 12 March 2024, 
Official Report, PQ 17709 Written questions and answers - Written questions, 
answers and statements - UK Parliament and 12 March 2024, Official Report, House 
of Lords, Cols. 1901-1904. Ministers: Legal Costs - Hansard - UK Parliament. 

Immigration: Databases 

Kevin Brennan:        

 [19004] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what recent estimate he has 
made of the number of individuals misidentified by the Home Office Person Centric Data 
Platform in the last 12 months. 

Kevin Brennan:        

 [19005] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps he is taking to rectify 
the misidentification of individuals by the Home Office Person Centric Data Platform. 

Tom Pursglove: 
The Person Centric Data Platform (PCDP) holds millions of identities that have been 
submitted or otherwise provided in support of immigration applications. Individuals 
have not been âmisidentifiedâ by the PCDP. Rather, the Home Office has for some 
time been aware of issues around âmerged identityâ - where a single âidentity islandâ 
has been formed with data belonging to two or more individuals. 

The âmerged identitiesâ issue affects around 0.02% of PCDP customer records - over 
99.98% of records are not impacted by this issue. We have identified around 46,000 
records with an identity issue, of which over 13,000 have already been resolved and 
we have a dedicated team working on the remainder. 

 
The Home Office takes data security and accuracy very seriously. We continue 
detailed analysis to identify erroneous PCDP records so that appropriate remedial 
work can be undertaken as quickly, and as carefully, as possible. 

Where customers identify an issue with their data, we encourage them to contact the 
UK Visas and Immigration Contact Centre to enable this to be investigated and 
resolved. 

Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration 

Dame Diana Johnson:        

 [19576] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what functions the office of the 
Independent Chief Inspector of Borders is able to undertake while the post of 
Independent Chief Inspector is vacant. 

Michael Tomlinson: 
The office of the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration has a clear 
plan of work, comprising of inspection activity, pre-inspection scoping activity, and 
non-inspection/corporate work that can continue whilst the post remains vacant. 

A new Chief Inspector will be appointed in accordance with the Cabinet Officeâs 
Governance Code on Public Appointments. A recruitment campaign is underway, and 
an appointment will be made as soon as practically possible. 

  Muslims: Safety 

Sarah Owen:        

 [19480] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to his 
Department's news story of 11 March 2024 entitled Government commits more funding to 
protect UK Muslims, what the eligibility criteria for applications for that funding will be; 
how bids for funding will be (a) assessed and (b) decided upon; and which Government 
department will be responsible for providing that funding. 

Tom Tugendhat: 
In light of increased reports of anti-Muslim hatred following the start of the 
Israel/Hamas conflict, an additional Â£4.9 million was made available in October for 
protective security at mosques and Muslim faith schools, bringing total funding 
available for 2023/24 to Â£29.4 million. The Government has confirmed that this level 
of funding will now be maintained annually through to 2027/28. 

Mosques and Muslim faith community centres can register for protective security 
measures through the Home Officeâs Protective Security for Mosques Scheme on 
GOV.UK. The scheme provides physical protective security measures, such as 
CCTV, intruder alarms and secure perimeter fencing. Due diligence checks are 
carried out by the Home Office; for example, to confirm that applicants are eligible 
registered charities. Following approval, applicants receive a site survey to assess 
the most suitable security measures for their site, which are funded by the Home 
Office and installed by the Departmentâs delivery partner. Security officer services will 
also become available through the scheme later this year. 

 
  Police Stations: Chesterfield 

Mr Toby Perkins:        

 [19042] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what improvements he plans to 
make to the Police estate in Chesterfield constituency until 2029. 

Chris Philp: 
Derbyshireâs funding will be up to Â£244.8m in 2024/25, an increase of up to Â£15.4m 
when compared to 2023/24. 

It is up to Chief Constables and directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners to 
make decisions on local resourcing and estates, including police stations. They are 
best placed to make these decisions based on their local knowledge and experience. 

  Theft: Retail Trade 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [18941] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what steps he is taking to tackle 
retail theft. 

Chris Philp: 
The Government recognises the significant impact shoplifting has on businesses, 
communities, and consumers. The Crime Survey for England and Wales shows 
neighbourhood crime is down 51% compared to findings from the year ending March 
2010. 

However, Police Recorded Crime figures show shoplifting offences increased by 32% 
in the 12 months to September 2023. Statistics also show the number of people 
charged with shoplifting offences has risen by 34% in the year ending September 
2023, showing that police are taking action. 

We have recently taken significant steps to improve the police response to retail 
crime, including shoplifting. 

In October 2023, the National Police Chiefsâ Council (NPCC) published the Retail 
Crime Action Plan. Through this Plan, all forces across England and Wales have 
committed to prioritise police attendance at the scene where violence has been used 
towards shop staff, where an offender has been detained by store security, and 
where evidence needs to be secured and can only be done by police personnel. 
Additionally, where CCTV or other digital images are secured, police will run this 
through the Police National Database to aid efforts to identify prolific offenders or 
potentially dangerous individuals. 

This builds on the NPCC commitment that police forces across England and Wales 
will follow up all crimes where there is actionable evidence and the chance of 
identifying an offender, including shoplifting. 

October also saw the launch of Pegasus, a unique private-public partnership, which 
involves retailers providing data, intelligence and evidence to Opal, the national 

police intelligence unit on organised acquisitive crime, to develop a better strategic 
picture and help forces crack down on serious offenders. 

We are continuing to work closely with retail businesses, security representatives, 
trade associations and policing through the National Retail Crime Steering Group 
(NRCSG), which meets on a quarterly basis, to ensure the response to retail crime, 
including shoplifting, is as robust as it can be. 

  Visas: Ethnic Groups and Women 

Deidre Brock:        

 [19084] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to his Oral 
Statement of 4 December 2023 on Legal Migration, Official Report, column 41, and the 
report by the Migration Observatory entitled Family fortunes: The UKâs new income 
requirement for partner visas, published on 1 February 2024, whether he has had 
discussions with Cabinet colleagues on the potential impact of the increased Minimum 
Income Requirement on (a) women and (b) people belonging to specific ethnicities. 

Deidre Brock:        

 [19085] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to his Oral 
Statement of 4 December 2023 on Legal Migration, Official Report, column 41, whether 
he has made an assessment of the potential impact of the increase to the minimum 
income requirement on (a) equality of opportunity and (b) reducing negative disparities. 

Tom Pursglove: 
Any discussions that take place between Cabinet Ministers are confidential. 

A full regulatory Impact Assessment will be developed, and the Government will 
publish an Equality Impact Assessment on this change, and both will be published in 
due course. We will continue to monitor the policy throughout its implementation. 

  Visas: Graduates 

Navendu Mishra:        

 [19489] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, for what reason he requested 
that Professor Brian Bell undertake a rapid review of the Graduate route. 

Navendu Mishra:        

 [19490] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will make an assessment of 
the economic impact of scrapping the Graduate Route. 

Tom Pursglove: 
The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), led by Professor Brian Bell, has been 
commissioned to provide further evidence to support the Governmentâs 
understanding of how the Graduate route is operating in practice and to what extent it 
is supporting the original objectives. 

No decisions have been made on the future of the Graduate route. We will consider 
evidence put forward by the MAC closely and ensure any policy proposals are 
subject to rigorous assessment of their impacts. 

  Visas: Personal Income 

Colum Eastwood:        

 [19742] 

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what the evidential basis is for 
increasing the minimum income requirement (MIR) to Â£38,700 for certain family and work 
visas; if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of increasing the MIR on 
those affected in (a) Derry City and Strabane and (b) other regions where average gross 
annual earnings are below the national average; and if he will ensure that the 
Government's planned impact assessment of increasing the MIR includes an equality 
impact assessment. 

Tom Pursglove: 
Analytical work has been undertaken across Government to support decision making 
in this process. A fact sheet and an initial assessment on the impact of the changes 
on immigration can be found on GOV.UK at: 

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/fact-sheet-on-net-migration-measures-
further-detail 

and 

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/legal-migration-statement-
estimated-immigration-impacts/legal-migration-statement-estimated-
immigration-impacts-accessible. 

A full Regulatory Impact Assessment on these changes has been developed and the 
Government will publish this alongside an Equality Impact Assessment on this 
change, both in due course. 

  JUSTICE 

  Community Orders: Suspended Sentences 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [15829] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many hours of unpaid work handed down 
as part of suspended sentences were cancelled as a result of not having been completed 
within 12 months of the sentence being handed down, in each of the last five years. 

Edward Argar: 
The disruption caused by the pandemic added to a backlog of Unpaid Work hours. 
The Government is investing an additional Â£93m in Community Payback over three 
years. This will allow us to increase delivery of Community Payback back to pre-covid 
levels of delivery. 

We have launched a national campaign to recruit more than 500 additional 
Community Payback staff to bolster resources in every probation region and new 
staff are arriving in post. The additional staffing will enable us to boost delivery of 
Community Payback to pre-covid levels. 

There will be a particular focus on delivering more outdoor projects that improve local 
areas, sustainability focussed and allow the public to see justice being done. 

Suspended Sentence Orders cannot legally be extended beyond the length of the 
operational period of the order which is set by the judiciary. A Suspended Sentence 
Order ceases the moment the operational period expires, regardless of any 
outstanding requirements such as unpaid work. Robust processes have been 
developed to ensure unpaid work requirements are completed in a timely manner, 
including prompt enforcement action where required. 

It is important to note that these hours have not been âcancelledâ but due to the legal 
limitations of a Suspended Sentence Order, the Probation Service is unable to apply 
for an extension in order to work hours once the operational period has expired.

of the total completed hours delivered as detailed in PQ 171423. 

By way of comparison, in 2023, 279,640 hours remained on expired Suspended 
Sentence Orders, while during the twelve months 01/04/2022 to 31/03/2023, over 4.7 
million hours of Unpaid Work were delivered. 

A number of these expired orders will be as a result of persons being remanded in 
custody or otherwise unable to complete their hours within the operational period. 
Additionally, others may have expired due to delays in enforcement, particularly as a 
result of Covid. 

Data are sourced from nDelius and while these data have been assured as much as 
practical, as with any large administrative dataset, the data should not be assumed to 
be accurate to the last value presented. 

 
  Criminal Proceedings: Royal Commissions 

Dan Carden:        

 [19696] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what progress his Department has made on 
establishing a Royal Commission on the criminal justice process. 

Mike Freer: 
Although we recognise the opportunity that a Royal Commission could present to 
look at structural questions in the criminal justice system, we think it is right that, 
following the pandemic and the Criminal Bar Associationâs disruptive action, we focus 
on delivering priority measures to speed up justice for victims and improve the justice 
system over the coming months. 

We continue to keep issues in the wider criminal justice system under review. 

  Ministry of Justice: Procurement 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [18964] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, if he will publish a contract and schedule of 
requirements for the contract with procurement reference tender_422492/1326965. 

Mike Freer: 
The contract and schedule of requirements for reference tender_422492/1326965 
was published on 20 March 2024 and can be found via the following link: 
https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/d08dc21c-90ec-4912-bc7b-
766b17bf266b. 

HMPPS does not tolerate violence under any circumstance, therefore it is vital we do 
everything in our power to eradicate dangerous behaviour behind bars. This 
information relates directly to an early-stage trial of equipment, which alongside wider 
investments into prison security measures such as body warn cameras and x-ray 
body scanners, will ensure we enhance prison safety and security for our 
hardworking staff and prisoners. 

  Prison Accommodation 

Shabana Mahmood:        

 [17728] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, what progress his Department has made on 
providing 20,000 additional prison places by 2025. 

Edward Argar: 
We are delivering 20,000 additional, modern prison places, the largest prison build 
programme since the Victorian era, ensuring the right conditions are in place to 
rehabilitate prisoners, helping to cut crime and protect the public.â¯â¯So far, c.5,900 
additional places have been completed. This includes our two new c.1,700 place 
prisons, HMP Five Wells, which opened in 2022 and HMP Fosse Way, which opened 
last year. It also includes, among others, c.590 Rapid Deployment Cells (RDCs) now 
in place across 11 sites. 

There was no commitment to deliver 20,000 additional prison places by 2025. By the 
end of 2025, we are on track to have delivered around 10,000 places in total. This will 
include our third new prison, HMP Millsike, delivering c.1,500 places, new 
houseblocks at HMPs Stocken and Rye Hill, as well as hundreds more RDCs. 

We have secured outline planning permission for our fourth new prison, near the 
existing HMP Gartree in Leicestershire, and for our fifth new prison, near the existing 
HMP Grendon in Buckinghamshire. We will now seek to deliver those new places as 
quickly as possible. 

We are continuing to push ahead with further options to deliver capacity across the 
estate, including looking at all options for accelerating timelines. 

Ruth Cadbury:        

 [19382] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many and what proportion of prisoners 
were sharing a one-person cell with another person on (a) 1 March 2021, (b) 1 March 
2022 and (c) 1 March 2023. 

Edward Argar: 
Crowding levels are published annually in the HMPPS Prison Digest. Figures for the 
last three years for the number of prisoners sharing a one-person cell with another 
person for that year can be found in the documents here: 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmpps-annual-digest-april-2020-to-march-
2021. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmpps-annual-digest-april-2021-to-march-
2022. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hmpps-annual-digest-april-2022-to-march-
2023. 

The accompanying annex to the latest publication, titled âChapter 2 Tables â Prison 
Crowdingâ provides the percentage of prisoners sharing a one-person cell with 
another person for each year since 1996. 

The determination of the maximum crowded capacity of a particular establishment is 
a matter of operational judgement, considering risks to safety and stability. 

By the end of this SR period, we will have invested nearly Â£4 billion towards the 
delivery of 20,000 modern and uncrowded prison places, the biggest prison build 
programme since the Victorian era, ensuring the right conditions are in place to 
rehabilitate prisoners, helping to cut crime, and protect the public. We have delivered 
c.5,900 of these and by the end of 2025, we will have delivered over 10,000 in total. 

These places are being delivered through the construction of six new prisons, as well 
as the expansion and refurbishment of the existing estate and temporary 
accommodation.â¯ We are also continuing to invest in prison maintenance so that 
existing places remain in use and are safe. 

Ruth Cadbury:        

 [19628] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, whether he has made an estimate of the 
number of proposed new prison places that will be rapid deployment cells. 

Edward Argar: 
We are delivering 20,000 prison places, the largest prison build programme since the 
Victorian era. As part of this, and alongside further opportunities to optimise capacity 
in the estate, the estimated number of proposed new prison places that will be Rapid 
Deployment Cells is c.1,800. Delivery of the first c.1000 began last year, with c.630 
already delivered across 12 sites. 

  Prison Accommodation: Construction 

Shabana Mahmood:        

 [17729] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Justice, how many prison cells have been built in each 
year since 2010, broken down by cell type. 

Edward Argar: 
As some cells hold more than one person, the operational capacity of the prison 
estate is best understood by the number of places rather than number of cells, and 
this is how data is recorded by HMPPS. 

The below table provides a summary of the number of prison places which have 
opened in each year since 2010, broken down into Adult Male, Female and CYPSE 
(Children and Young Peopleâs Estate). Please note that, for simplicity, all places 
relating to a prison opening are included in the year that the prison opened. In 
practice, a new prison may take more than a year before reaching its final operational 
capacity.

We continue to push ahead with the largest prison expansion programme since the 
Victorian Era â with 10,000 of the pledged 20,000 additional places to be delivered by 
the end of 2025. 

We have also put in place short-term measures across the prison estate to expand 
capacity by the equivalent of around 2,000 places since September 2022, through 
doubling up cells and delaying non-urgent maintenance work where safe to do so. 
Thousands of places are also being created through the expansion of prisons through 
additional house blocks and major refurbishments at existing prisons and we are 
rolling out Rapid Deployment Cells across the estate, with c.590 already delivered at 
eleven sites. 

  Wetherby Young Offender Institution

under the age of 15 (a) have been placed in the last 12 months and (b) are expected to 
be placed within the next 12 months at the Wetherby and Keppel Young Offender 
Institution. 

Edward Argar: 
No girls under 15 have been placed at HMYOI Wetherby in the last 12 months. We 
do not expect to make any such placement in the next 12 months. 

  Women's Centres: Swansea 

Liz Saville Roberts:        

 [19654]

 [19535] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, what discussions he has had with Iain 
Livingstone on the publication timetable for the final report from Operation Kenova. 

Chris Heaton-Harris: 
I met with Sir Iain Livingstone on 6 March 2024 and updated him on the

Autistica, a UK based charity engaged in funding and campaigning for research on 
autism and related conditions, is receiving Â£378k through Government support for 
Early Career Researcher fund. 

  Digital Technology: Wigan 

Lisa Nandy:        

 [19342] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, what steps her 
Department is taking to tackle digital exclusion among older people in Wigan 
constituency. 

Saqib Bhatti: 
The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is responsible for 
coordinating HMG digital inclusion policy as part of its commitment to ensuring that 
no one is left behind in the digital age. Digital inclusion is a cross-cutting issue that 
spans social engagement, education, employment, access to services and many 
more elements of everyday life. 

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology leads on telecoms and 
digital infrastructure, including Project Gigabit, the Governmentâs Â£5 billion mission to 
deliver lightning-fast, reliable broadband to the hardest to reach parts of the UK. In 
the Wigan constituency, over 98% of premises can access a superfast connection 
(>=30Mbps), while 92% can access a gigabit-capable connection, up from 0.8% in 
December 2019. Both of these current figures are higher than the national averages 
of 97% and 81% for superfast and gigabit-capable coverage, respectively. 

More broadly across Government, the Cabinet Office is working to remove barriers 
and ensure online services are as inclusive as possible by making public sector 
websites accessible to as many people as possible. The Cabinet Office leads on the 
Service Standard, a set of principles government service teams and departments 
must adhere to when creating and running new public services â such as the NHS â 
and some Local Authorities, including Greater Manchester Combined Authority, have 
committed to using these as well. 

Training is available for elderly people wishing to acquire essential digital skills. 
Department for Education has introduced a digital entitlement for adults with no or 
low digital skills to undertake specified digital qualifications, up to level 1, free of 
charge. Essential Digital Skills Qualifications, introduced alongside the digital 
entitlement, are based on new national standards which set out the digital skills 
people need to get on in life and work. 

We also recognise that ongoing support is essential to overcome barriers of access. 
Our network of 2,900 public libraries across England provide a trusted network of 
accessible locations with staff, volunteers, free Wi-Fi, public PCs, and assisted digital 
access to a wide range of digital services. 

  Research: East Midlands 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18838] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, how much funding 
her Department has provided to research projects based in (a) Lincolnshire and (b) the 
East Midlands in the last 12 months. 

Andrew Griffith: 
In the 12 months to start of January 2024, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) 
awarded: 

â¢  Â£4.7m to organisations performing research projects in Lincolnshire. 

â¢  Â£146m to organisations performing research projects in the East Midlands. 

These figures include a range of investments made via UKRIâs Research Councils 
and Innovate UK, but the figure excludes formula-based block grants deployed 
through universities which will also have gone to research projects in this region. 

  TRANSPORT 

  Active Travel: Economic Situation 

Fabian Hamilton:        

 [19259] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment he has made of the 
potential implications for his policies of Create Streets' report entitled Move Free, 
published on 19 March 2024. 

Guy Opperman: 
The Honourable Gentleman for Leeds North East introduced me at the launch of the 
report, where I spoke. I have read it, and will ensure the Department and Active 
Travel England take its findings into account in the development of future policy and 
programmes. 

  Department for Transport: Domestic Visits 

Jonathan Ashworth:        

 [19366] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, on how many occasions Ministers from his 
Department have visited (a) Wales, (b) Scotland and (c) Northern Ireland in each of the 
last three financial years. 

Anthony Browne: 
 [Holding answer 22 March 2024]: DfT ministers regularly visit places across the UK. 
In the 2023/24 financial year, DfT ministers made 7 visits to Wales, 6 to Scotland and 
2 to Northern Ireland. 

  European Company for the Financing of Railroad Rolling Stock Convention 

Grahame Morris:        

 [19321] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
merits of the UK signing up to the European Company for the Financing of Railroad 
Rolling Stock convention. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Government is supportive of international initiatives to help deliver new vehicles 
and upgrade existing fleets that improve passenger experience and support our 
decarbonisation objectives. We are committed to encouraging investment in domestic 
and international rail services and unlocking greater private financing to support this. 

My officials have engaged regularly with Eurofima, the company established by the 
convention, to discuss the potential opportunities and costs associated with it. 
However, given the significant membership requirements of Eurofima, any decision 
would be subject to the usual value for money considerations. 

  Great Western Main Line 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19443] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether his Department has made an 
estimate of the projected number of weekend closures that will take place on the Reading 
and London Paddington in the next 12 months. 

Huw Merriman: 
I understand that Network Rail plans to close the Great Western Main Line in the Old 
Oak Common area on Sunday 17 November, Saturday 28 December and Sunday 29 
December 2024 to enable both construction works for the new station at Old Oak 
Common as well as other essential works required in this area. 

  High Speed 2 Line: Old Oak Common Station 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19442] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what steps his Department is taking to 
minimise disruption to South West rail passengers in the context of the construction of the 
new High Speed 2 station at Old Oak Common. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Department is working with Network Rail, HS2 Ltd, Transport for London and 
train operating companies to minimise disruption to South West rail passengers. 
Diversions of services to other London terminals, such as Euston, is under active 
consideration. This could provide Great Western Railway passengers access to a 
central London terminal with numerous onward travel connections. Passengers could 
alternatively use Ealing Broadway station, as they did successfully during the 
December 2023 engineering works. 

  Housing: Construction 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19032] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
implications for his policies of the Create Streets and Sustrans report entitled Stepping off 
the Road to Nowhere, published on 10 March 2024. 

Guy Opperman: 
The Government is aware of the report produced by Create Streets and Sustrans and 
will review its findings in due course. 

  Logistics: Energy 

Andrew Lewer:        

 [19167] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment he has made of the 
potential impact of the (a) cost of energy asset extensions for the logistics sector and (b) 
time taken to deliver energy asset extensions on the introduction of logistics fleet depot 
charging. 

Guy Opperman: 
The Department for Transport (DfT) has established the Freight Energy Forum to 
address the challenges and provide solutions for the provision of zero carbon energy 
infrastructure for the freight and logistics sector. 

Through the Forum, this government is working with industry to take a holistic 
approach to understand the future energy demand required for the freight and 
logistics sector to decarbonise, as this is an essential component in order to 
determine the energy asset extensions it will need. 

As such, an assessment of the cost and potential impact of energy asset extensions 
or the time it will take to deliver them has not been undertaken. However, we are in 
regular contact with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) 
where discussions include the energy infrastructure needs of the freight and logistics 
sector. 

  Old Oak Common Station: Construction 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19444] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether he has made an assessment of the 
potential impact of construction work being undertaken at Old Oak Common station on 
(a) local rail disruption and (b) businesses that support tourism in the South West. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Department is working with Network Rail, HS2 Ltd, Transport for London (TfL) 
and train operators to minimise disruption. 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19445] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what steps his Department plans to take to 
help ensure stakeholders in (a) Wales and (b) the South West receive communications 

on the potential impact of Old Oak Common station construction work on (i) rail journey 
times and (ii) service disruption. 

Huw Merriman: 
Similar to last year, public communications regarding the works are due to ramp up 
ahead of this yearâs Christmas engineering works, in line with usual passenger 
communications timing. Network Rail is leading the development of a passenger 
communications strategy working closely with train operators and other industry 
partners, including Transport for London (TfL). My Department is working with 
Network Rail, HS2 Ltd, TfL and the train operating companies to minimise the 
impacts of disruption. The most extensive possessions will be in 2026 and 2028 and 
stakeholders and the public will be informed well in advance. 

  P&O Ferries 

Grahame Morris:        

 [19319] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what recent discussions his Department has 
had with P&O Ferries. 

Guy Opperman: 
We welcome P&O Ferriesâ statement that it is committed to signing the Seafarersâ 
Charter, following Brittany Ferries, Condor, DFDS and Stena Line in committing to 
work towards meeting its requirements. 

Following P&O Ferriesâ commitment, officials met representatives of the company on 
Monday 18 March for a technical discussion on how compliance with the Charter 
requirements should be demonstrated. We anticipate further such discussions. 

  Parking: Fees and Charges 

Gen Kitchen:        

 [19513] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether he has made an assessment of the 
potential merits of allocating additional funding to (a) towns and (b) villages with free 
parking to help maintain those free services. 

Guy Opperman: 
Local authorities are at liberty to provide free or charged parking. The Department for 
Transport is taking steps through the Plan for Drivers to ensure that enforcement is 
fair and proportionate. 

  Pedicabs: Licensing 

Sir Christopher Chope:        

 [19519] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what information his Department holds on (a) 
the number of pedicabs outside Greater London that are licensed as (i) taxis and (ii) 
private hire vehicles and (b) the number and proportion of those pedicabs that are in (A) 
Oxford, (B) Salisbury, (C) Bristol and (D) Cambridge; and if he will make an assessment 
of the potential impact on the number of licensed pedicabs of paragraph 8.3 of his 

Department's guidance entitled Taxi and private hire vehicle licensing best practice 
guidance for licensing authorities in England, updated on 17 November 2023. 

Sir Christopher Chope:        

 [19520] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, with reference to paragraph 8.3 of his 
Department's publication entitled Taxi and private hire vehicle licensing best practice 
guidance for licensing authorities in England, updated on 17 November 2023, what 
guidance his Department plans to provide on the appropriate adjustments that licensing 
authorities should make to their licensing requirements for drivers and vehicles to provide 
pedicab services outside Greater London. 

Guy Opperman: 
Outside London pedicabs can be licensed as taxis. Pedicabs cannot be licensed as a 
private hire vehicle as legislation defines a private hire vehicle as a motor vehicle. 
The Department for Transport issues guidance on licensing taxis and private hire 
vehicles to authorities who should consider the recommendations made and their 
obligation under the Regulatorsâ Code to carry out their activities in a way that 
supports those they regulate to comply and grow. The Best Practice Guidance to 
licensing authorities in England sets out that where there is local interest in providing 
pedicab services, licensing authorities should make appropriate adjustments to their 
licensing requirements for drivers and vehicles to accommodate these requests. 
Subject to the legal requirements, it is for licensing authorities to consider the 
appropriate licensing requirements to operate a pedicab under a taxi and taxi driver 
licence. 

The Department does not hold data on the number of pedicabs licensed as taxis in 
England. 

  Railways: Carbon Emissions 

Grahame Morris:        

 [19318] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether he has made an assessment of the 
adequacy of Network Rail's Traction Decarbonisation Network Strategy. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Traction Decarbonisation Network Strategy (TDNS) was published by Network 
Rail in 2020 and primarily recommended electrification as a means to decarbonise 
the rail network. 

The TDNS was used by Government as a guide for decision making. However, 
alternative traction technologies, such as battery and bi-mode trains, will also play 
key roles in our transition to Net Zero. We are progressing work on a whole systems 
approach to decarbonisation by ensuring both track and train are considered. 

The Government still expects electrification to play an important role in our 
programme to achieve our Net Zero 2050 target, which is why since 2010, more than 
1,250 miles of electrification has been delivered in Great Britain, including over 900 
miles in England and Wales in the last 11 years. 

  Railways: Public Appointments 

Grahame Morris:        

 [19320] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what recruitment process his Department 
followed for the recent appointment of the Director General for Rail Services on 18 March 
2024. 

Huw Merriman: 
On 18 March 2024 the Department for Transport announced the appointment of Alex 
Hynes to the role of Director General for Rail Services. Alex has been appointed 
through a time-bound secondment agreement with Network Rail. Appropriate 
approvals were sought and obtained including from the Cabinet Office, HM Treasury 
and Civil Service Commission. 

  Railways: Shrewsbury 

Helen Morgan:        

 [19749] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will instruct Avanti West Coast to hold a 
public consultation on its planned withdrawal of the Shrewsbury to Euston service. 

Helen Morgan:        

 [19750] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether his permission was required for 
Avanti West Coast to withdraw its direct Shrewsbury to Euston service. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Department is required to make decisions as part of industry wide efforts to align 
timetables to changing demand patterns and restore the financial stability of the 
railway, the Government asked all operators to present cost saving options. Due to 
very low passenger numbers, the service between Shrewsbury and London is 
currently operating at a loss of Â£1.4 million per year. West Midlands Railway (WMR) 
and Transport for Wales provide sufficient capacity for passengers between 
Shrewsbury and Birmingham, and the Department has agreed that WMR will 
introduce a second hourly Birmingham to Shrewsbury semi-fast service in June 2024 
to operate via the Stour Valley and provide quicker journey time between Shropshire 
towns and Birmingham. 

Government support for the operational railway was almost Â£12 billion in the last 
financial year â equivalent to more than Â£420 per household. The Secretary of Stateâs 
decision to withdraw a service operating at a loss estimated at Â£1.4 million every 
year, was taken to help reduce public subsidy and restore the financial sustainability 
of the railway. No public consultation is planned as, given these clear financial 
constraints, meaningful consultation is not possible, as it would not alter the outcome. 

  Roads: Lincolnshire 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [19528] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, how much reallocated HS2 funding has been 
given to Lincolnshire County Council for road resurfacing. 

Huw Merriman: 
Lincolnshire County Council will receive a minimum additional overall uplift of Â£287.7 
million between 2023-24 and 2033-34 as a result of reallocating HS2 funding. Â£4.9 
million of this has already been paid out in the current financial year with a further 
Â£4.9 million to follow in 2024/25, and Lincolnshire is receiving around 30% more 
capital funding for highway maintenance in the current financial year than it did in the 
previous financial year. 

Funding allocations beyond 2024/25 are a matter for the next Spending Review. 

  Roads: Repairs and Maintenance 

Fabian Hamilton:        

 [19536] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what assessment he has made of the 
implications for his policies of the Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance Survey 
Report, published on 19 March 2024. 

Guy Opperman: 
The Government takes the condition of local roads very seriously, which is why it has 
reallocated Â£8.3 billion of HS2 funding to help tackle some of the issues highlighted in 
the report in question. This funding will be on top of what local authorities were 
expecting to receive over the next decade, and will, over time, allow them to 
transform the condition of their local highway networks. 

  Shipping: Pay 

Grahame Morris:        

 [19594] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will list the mandatory employment 
conditions excluding national minimum wage rates which apply to seafarers working on 
routes between maritime ports in the territorial waters of (a) the UK and (b) France. 

Guy Opperman: 
Extensive details of mandatory employment conditions for seafarers are set out in 
international conventions including the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 and 
corresponding UK legislation. 

In addition to improving working conditions through our Nine Point Plan for Seafarer 
Protections, the UK continues to play a leading role internationally in improving 
seafarer welfare. 

  Transport: Planning 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [19164] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, whether he has made an assessment of the 
potential implications for his policies of the Create Streets and Sustrans study entitled 
Stepping off the Road to Nowhere, published on 10 March 2024. 

Huw Merriman: 
The Government is aware of the report produced by Create Streets and Sustrans and 
will review its findings in due course. 

  TREASURY 

  Alcoholic Drinks: Excise Duties 

Julian Sturdy:        

 [19611] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
merits of reducing alcohol duty for independent wine merchants. 

Gareth Davies: 
At Spring Budget 2024, the Chancellor announced that alcohol duty will be frozen 
until 1 February 2025 to support alcohol producers, pubs, and consumers with cost of 
living pressures. This extends the six month freeze the Government announced at 
Autumn Statement 2023 to give businesses time to adapt to the new duty system 
introduced on 1 August 2023. 

As with all taxes, the Government keeps the alcohol duty system under review during 
its yearly Budget process. 

  Cash Dispensing: Lincolnshire 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18841] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what recent assessment his Department has 
made of the adequacy of the availability of cash withdrawal facilities in Lincolnshire. 

Bim Afolami: 
The government recognises that cash continues to be used by millions of people 
across the UK, including those who may be in vulnerable groups. 

The government legislated through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 to 
establish a new legislative framework to protect access to cash. This establishes the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as the lead regulator for access to cash and 
provides it with responsibility and powers to seek to ensure reasonable provision of 
cash withdrawal and deposit facilities, on both a national and local basis. The FCA 
expects to finalise its regulatory rules in the third quarter of this year. 

The most recent analysis undertaken by the FCA is available on the FCA website: 
Access to cash coverage in the UK 2023 Q1 

  Climate Change: Investment 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19040] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what assessment he has made of (a) the 
economy-wide investment needs for adapting the UK to climate change and (b) the 
current funding gap. 

Gareth Davies: 
The Government is taking action to respond to climate risks and their impacts on our 
economy and way of life. The Third National Adaptation Programme (NAP3) was 
published in July 2023. It set out policies and actions to respond to the 61 climate 
risks and opportunities identified in the Third Climate Change Risk Assessment 
(CCRA3). 

There is significant public investment underpinning the policies and actions in NAP3, 
with the Government having committed a record-breaking Â£5.2 billion investment in 
flood and coastal schemes in England between 2021 and 2027, helping to better 
protect hundreds of thousands of properties and avoid Â£32 billion of wider economic 
damages. However, adaptation actions cannot be funded through public spending 
alone, and additional investment from the private sector will therefore be required to 
support adaptation action over the coming decades. The Government has committed 
to support the flow of this private finance into adaptation through the 2023 Green 
Finance Strategy. 

  Companies: Cost of Living and Inflation 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [19162] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what recent assessment he has made of the 
potential impact of the level of profits made by companies outside the oil and gas 
industries on (a) the cost of living and (b) inflation. 

Bim Afolami: 
The Government monitors UK corporatesâ performance on an ongoing basis. Profits 
as a share of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) for UK private non-financial 
corporations excluding firms in the UK Continental Shelf have been relatively stable 
since 2000. 

  Cost of Living 

Stephen Morgan:        

 [19160] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what assessment he has made of the impact of 
his measures introduced in the Spring Budget 2024 on the cost of living. 

Bim Afolami: 
The government has demonstrated its commitment to supporting the most vulnerable 
at Spring Budget 2024 â including the extension of the Household Support Fund, 
freezing fuel duty, and helping households in debt. 

The measures introduced by this government to support households have contributed 
to real incomes being stronger than expected this year. Real wages are now higher 
than pre-pandemic level. 

  Credit: Regulation 

Stella Creasy:        

 [19613] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with reference to his Department's consultation 
entitled Regulation of Buy-Now Pay-Later: consultation on draft legislation, how many 
responses were received; and of those received, how many and what proportion were 
from (a) buy-now-pay-later providers, (b) charities and advocacy groups, (c) other 
financial service providers who do not offer buy-now-pay-later products and (d) members 
of the public. 

Bim Afolami: 
A list of respondents will be included in the Governmentâs response to the 
consultation, which will be published in due course. 

  Debt Collection 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19138] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what steps he is taking to ensure that 
companies in the (a) finance and (b) utility sectors use best practice when collecting 
debts from vulnerable customers. 

Bim Afolami: 
The Government wants to see fair treatment of individuals in problem debt, and there 
is a range of work underway across government and regulators to promote 
responsible debt collection practices. 

In June 2023 the FCA, Ofgem, Ofwat and Ofcom published a joint letter via the UK 
Regulatorsâ Network (UKRN) setting out how firms in their respective sectors should 
support customers in financial difficulty. On 18 March 2024, the same group of 
regulators issued further guidance, setting out their shared expectations on firmsâ 
debt collection practices. This is to ensure that firms support customers in debt and 
that firmsâ collection practices are not causing harm to customers. 

  Holiday Accommodation: Taxation 

Anne Marie Morris:        

 [19067] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what data his Department used to estimate the 
number of short-term lets that would be suitable for primary residences when the 
furnished holiday let tax regime has ended. 

Nigel Huddleston: 
The Government has announced that it will abolish the Furnished Holiday Lettings 
(FHL) tax regime, equalising the tax treatment of landlords with short-term holiday 
lets and those with standard residential properties. This will make the taxation of 
property fairer and simpler while raising revenue for public services. The changes will 
not penalise or prohibit the provision of FHLs more widely. 

The Government keeps all aspects of tax policy under review and any decisions on 
future changes will be taken by the Chancellor in the context of the wider public 
finances. 

  Mortgages: Interest Rates 

Mr Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi:        

 [19136] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what steps he is taking to (a) help ensure 
mortgage rate stability and (b) support the housing market. 

Bim Afolami: 
The path to lower interest rates is through low inflation, and the Government is fully 
committed to supporting the Bank of England get inflation back down to the 2% 
target, including by keeping borrowing under control. 

While the pricing of mortgages is ultimately a commercial decision for lenders in 
which the Government does not intervene, our plan is working, and the average 
offered mortgage rates on 2-year and 5-year fixed rates are now lower compared to 
their peak in Summer 2023. The Governmentâs Mortgage Charter - in addition to the 
significant safeguards already in place - is providing support to vulnerable 
households; and mortgage arrears and repossessions remain low. 

Housebuilding is a priority for this Government. At SR21, we demonstrated the 
Governmentâs commitment to investing in safe and affordable housing by confirming 
a settlement of nearly Â£24 billion up to 2025-26. 

In 2022-2023, more than 230,000 net additional dwellings were delivered and 
government is on track to meet our commitment to deliver one million additional 
homes across this Parliament. 

  Tobacco: Sales 

Philip Davies:        

 [19577] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if he will make an assessment of the potential 
impact of banning the sale of tobacco products to people born after 1 January 2009 on 
tobacco duties. 

Gareth Davies: 
The Government published an Impact Assessment to support the âTobacco and 
Vapes Billâ on 20 March, which includes estimate of the reduction in tobacco duty 
over the period 2027 and 2056: 

Tobacco_and_vapes_bill_IA.pdf (parliament.uk) 

The impact of final decisions on tobacco duties will be assessed and reflected in the 
Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast. . 

  Treasury: Legal Costs 

Nick Thomas-Symonds:        

 [19109] 

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what the total cost to the public purse was of 
legal (a) support and (b) representation to Ministers in his Department in relation to their 
official conduct in each of the last three years. 

Gareth Davies: 
Such information is not centrally recorded or collated in the form requested. 

  WORK AND PENSIONS 

  Access to Work Programme 

Vicky Foxcroft:        

 [19403] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many people were waiting for 
a decision on their Access to Work application on 1 March 2024. 

Mims Davies: 
As of 1st March 2024, there were 29,871 applications awaiting a decision. 

Please note that the data supplied is derived from unpublished management 
information, which was collected for internal Departmental use only, and have not 
been quality assured to National Statistics or Official Statistics publication standard. 
They should therefore be treated with caution. 

  Children: Maintenance 

Drew Hendry:        

 [19632] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps his Department is 
taking to reduce call waiting times to the child maintenance service; and whether he has 
made a recent assessment of the adequacy of call handling times by that service. 

Paul Maynard: 
As part of its Modernisation Programme, CMS continues to improve how it 
communicates with customers and how customers access its service. When a 
customer first applies for CMS they are enrolled on the online service which provides 
them the ability to update their information and request changes 24 hours a day, 7 
days a week. The majority of our customers make use of these online services to 
effectively meet their needs every day, though we are actively engaged in improving 
the service further and increasing customer take up. 

We recognise some customers need alternative methods to contact us or choose to 
call us, and on occasion call wait times on our inbound phone lines can be longer 
than we would like. Speed to answer is continually reviewed throughout the working 
day and operational resource is regularly reviewed and flexed to minimise excessive 
wait times. 

Over the coming year we will increase customer education on what can be raised and 
progressed using our online services and encourage more customers to make use of 
this as the primary channel for their CMS enquiries. This will help protect our inbound 
phones lines for our customers that need to access our service in this way and 
reduce the wait time they experience. 

  Debts: Standard of Living 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [18957] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether he has made an 
assessment of the potential implications for his policies of the findings in the Christians 
Against Poverty report entitled Pushed under, pushed out, published on 12 March 2024, 
relating to the impact of high debt repayments on people's living standards. 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [18960] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will make an assessment of 
the implications for his policies of the report entitled Pushed Under, Pushed Out, 
published by Christians Against Poverty on 12 March 2024. 

Paul Maynard: 
No formal assessment has been made. 

  Employment: Autism 

Daisy Cooper:        

 [18947] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will make an assessment of 
the potential impact of average waiting times for autism assessments on employment 
rates. 

Mims Davies: 
There are no plans for DWP to make this specific assessment. Whilst we recognise 
the importance of early identification of autism, a diagnosis is not required to be 
eligible for reasonable adjustments and the provision of workplace support. These 
are made, in line with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010, based on functional 
need. 

We are encouraging employers to adopt more neuro-inclusive working practices, 
which benefit neurodiverse employees irrespective of whether they have a diagnosis. 
The Buckland Review into Autism Employment, published on 28 February this year, 
has created a focus for action to improve the recruitment and retention of autistic 
people. It has identified workplace barriers, and the working practices and initiatives 
that can reduce them, in order to create a more inclusive working environment for 
autistic employees and autistic jobseekers. 

This is supported by Disability Confident, our scheme to increase employersâ 
understanding of how to recruit, retain and support disabled employees and the 
Support with Employee Health and Disability online service which guides employers 

through health and disability scenarios at work, including making reasonable 
adjustments. 

  Household Support Fund 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19199] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what the total cost to the public 
purse was of the Household Support Fund since 2021; and what the total distribution of 
the fund per constituency over the same period. 

Jo Churchill: 
A total of Â£3bn including Barnett impact has been announced since October 2021 to 
enable the Household Support Fund to run in England. This includes over Â£2.5 bn 
allocated to Local Authorities in England. It is for the devolved administrations to 
decide how to allocate their additional Barnett funding. 

Allocations are made at an upper tier Local Authority, level based on population size 
and levels of deprivation. Allocations by Local Authority for schemes running between 
October 2021 to March 2024 can be found at the following links:

  Household Support Fund: Lewisham 

Ellie Reeves:        

 [19668] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether his Department provided 
Lewisham Council with an impact assessment on the discontinuation of funding for the 
Household Support Fund from March 2024. 

Jo Churchill: 
The government is providing an additional Â£500m to enable the extension of the 
Household Support Fund, including funding for the Devolved Administrations through 
the Barnett formula to be spent at their discretion. This means that Local Authorities 
in England will receive an additional Â£421m to support those in need locally through 
the Household Support Fund. 

The funding will be available to Local Authorities in England from 1 April 2024 and will 
run until 30 September 2024. 

  Jobcentres: Translation Services 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [19526] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate he has made of the 
cost to the public purse of translating languages in Job Centres since 2015. 

Jo Churchill: 
The information requested is not readily available and to provide it will incur 
disproportionate cost. 

  Pension Credit: Veterans 

Steve McCabe:        

 [19525] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many veterans received 
Pension Credit in the 2022-23 financial year. 

Paul Maynard: 
The information requested is not collected and could only be obtained at 
disproportionate cost. 

  Personal Independence Payment 

Marsha De Cordova:        

 [19456] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, with reference to his Department's 
publication entitled Transforming Support: The Health and Disability White Paper, 
published on 16 March 2023, what progress his Department has made on the test of the 
feasibility of sharing assessment reports with Personal Independent Payment applicants 
before a decision is made; and when he plans to publish the findings. 

Mims Davies: 
We are currently conducting a test to understand the impact of sharing assessment 
reports with PIP claimants by default. As part of the evaluation, we will gather insight 
from claimants to understand whether sharing the assessment report provides them 
with the opportunity to clarify evidence so that we can make the right decision as 
early as possible and improve trust and transparency in the decision-making process. 
Once the analysis of that insight is complete, we will consider next steps. 

  Poverty: Children 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19197] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate his Department has 
made of the number of children living in (a) absolute and (b) relative poverty in each year 
since 2007 in (i) England, (ii) Scotland, (iii) Wales, (iv) Northern Ireland and (v) the UK. 

Jo Churchill: 
Statistics on the number of Children living in absolute and relative poverty per country 
in the UK are published annually in the âHouseholds Below Average Incomeâ 
publication in âtable 4.22tsâ and âtable 4.17tsâ (respectively) of âchildren-hbai-

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19198] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate he has made of the 
number of children living in (a) absolute and (b) relative poverty per constituency in the 
latest period for which data is available. 

Jo Churchill: 
Statistics on the number of Children living in absolute and relative poverty per 
constituency are published annually in the âChildren in low income families: local area 
statisticsâ publication and can be found in tabs â6_Absolute_ParlCâ and 
â5_Relative_ParlCâ at Children in low income families: local area statistics 2014 to 
2023 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk). The latest statistics published on 21 March 2024 are 
for the financial period 2022/23. 

The latest available data can also be found on Stat-Xplore :  https://stat-
xplore.dwp.gov.uk/ 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19206] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, whether he has had recent 
discussions with (a) Unicef and (b) the United Nations Rapporteur on extreme poverty on 
initiatives to tackle child poverty. 

Jo Churchill: 
DWP officials engage with a wide range of stakeholders including UNICEF. 

  Sickness Benefits: South Holland and the Deepings 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [18839] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many people in South Holland 
and the Deepings constituency are on long-term sickness benefits; and how many were 
on such benefits in each of the last five years. 

Mims Davies: 
People on âlong-term sickness benefitsâ have been assumed as those in the main 
phase of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and the Universal Credit (UC) 
Limited Capability to Work (LCW) and Limited capability for work and work-related 
activity (LCWRA) groups. The Department regularly publishes Benefit Combination 
statistics on Stat-Xplore and these were extended inFebruary 2024 to include 
additional information for those on ESA and the UC Health Journey, so can now be 

used to provide the information, from quarter ending May 2019 to the end of the latest 
quarter, August 2023. 

The figures can be obtained from the â Benefit Combinations - Data from May 2019 
for England and Wales â dataset using the âAdditional Claim Detailsâ options. The 
âESA Phase of Claimâ and âUC Health Journeyâ options should be used to identify 
quarterly totals for ESA Support Group (SG), ESA Work-related Activity Group 
(WRAG), Universal Credit Limited Capability to Work (LCW) and Limited capability for 
work and work-related activity (LCWRA) groups and those on one benefit but not the 
other using the âNot Onâ options. The âGeographyâ option can then be used to filter by 
the relevant Westminster Parliamentary Constituency. 

Users can log in or access Stat-Xplore as a guest user and, if needed, can access 
guidance on how to extract the information required. 

Using the Benefit Combinations data on Stat-Xplore, the number of people on long-
term sickness benefits in the South Holland and the Deepings constituency is 
provided in the table below: 

AUG 2019

Source:Stat-Xplore 

Notes: 

1.  Totals are rounded to 10. 

2.  UC Data is not available prior to 2019 as some UC claims were recorded on an 
interim operational system called UC Live Service (UCLS). Figures for UCLS 
Health claimants are not currently collated and to develop that information would 
incur disproportionate cost. 

3.  A person can claim both ESA and be on the UC health caseload and these 

claimants would be counted in each separate caseload in the published data on 
Stat-Xplore. Benefit Combinations data on Stat-Xplore allows these 'Dual claims' to 
be identified and only counted once in the above. 

  Social Security Benefits: Children 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19201] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what estimate he has made of the 
total revenue accrued by the Exchequer since the introduction of the two child limit; and 
how many and what proportion of households are impacted in (i) England, (ii) Scotland, 
(iii) Wales, (iv) Northern Ireland and (v) each parliamentary constituency in the latest 
period for which data is available.

published here: Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit claimants: statistics related to 
the policy to provide support for amaximum of 2 children, April 2023 - GOV.UK 
(www.gov.uk) 

The information requested on savings is not available. 

Statistics related to the policy to provide support for a maximum of 2 children, by 
Parliamentary Constituencies isnât currently available. 

  Social Security Benefits: Long Covid 

Bell Ribeiro-Addy:        

 [19718] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps his Department is 
taking to provide benefit support to individuals with Long Covid. 

Mims Davies: 
People living with a condition arising from exposure to the Covid-19 virus can access 
the financial support that is available through Statutory Sick Pay, Universal Credit, 
New Style ESA or Pension Credit depending on individual circumstances. 

Disability benefits such as Personal Independence Payment or Attendance 
Allowance do not include or exclude by condition, instead they look at the needs 
arising from a long-term health condition or disability. Therefore people living with a 
condition arising from exposure to the Covid-19 virus are also able to access these 
benefits in the same way as other people with long-term conditions or disabilities. 

  Unemployed People 

Sir John Hayes:        

 [19776] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, how many and what proportion of 
people of working age in (a) Lincolnshire, (b) East Midlands and (c) England are (i) not 
working and (ii) not looking for a job.

  Universal Credit 

Dame Siobhain McDonagh:        

 [18958] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will make an assessment of 
the potential merits of reducing the maximum benefit deduction rate for people on 
Universal Credit. 

Paul Maynard: 
The primary aim of the deductions in Universal Credit is to protect claimants by 
providing a last resort repayment method for arrears of essential services. 

Making deductions from a claimantâs benefit is a cost effective and efficient 
mechanism to recover third party debt and benefit debt. Regulations protect 
claimants from excessive deductions. There are limits set for individual deduction 
items, there is also an overall deduction cap set at 25% of standard allowance, 
although where necessary to support the claimant, this can be exceeded for rent and 
fuel debts. 

  Universal Credit: Housing 

Caroline Lucas:        

 [19031] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will make it his policy to bring 
homeowner service charge support in Universal Credit in line with Support for Mortgage 
Interest by (a) removing the zero earnings rule and (b) reducing the nine month qualifying 
period. 

Mims Davies: 
The Department has no plans to amend the support that homeowners receive in 
respect of service charges. 

  Universal Credit: Rents 

Wera Hobhouse:        

 [18923] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps he is taking to ensure 
that social housing tenants who receive Universal Credit are not financially affected by 
the 53-week rent year in the 2024-25 financial year. 

Mims Davies: 
In the financial year 2024-25 social housing tenants will face 52 weekly rent payment 
days so Universal Credit will make provision for the exact amount of their liability. 

Universal Credit always converts weekly amounts to monthly sums using 52 weeks. 
This may lead to a slight advantage to the claimant when converting weekly incomes 
and to a slight disadvantage when dealing with outgoings. The system is used 
because it is simple to operate and understand. The department has considered 
alternative optionsâ¯for those with weeklyâ¯tenancies,â¯but each have their own 
limitations and disadvantages for claimants and so there are no plans to change. 

The legitimacy of this calculation formula in Universal Credit was confirmed by the 
High Court in 2020 who found it to be neither irrational or discriminatory. 

Discretionary Housing Payments can be paid to those entitled to Housing Benefit or 
the housing element of Universal Credit who face a shortfall in meeting their housing 
costs. Since 2011, the government has provided nearly Â£1.7 billion in Discretionary 
Housing Payments to local authorities. 

  Universal Credit: Uprating 

Kenny MacAskill:        

 [19205] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, if he will make an assessment of 
the potential merits of increasing universal credit by 50% in financial year 2024-25. 

Jo Churchill: 
There are no plans to make such an assessment. 

  Veterans: Universal Credit 

Steve McCabe:        

 [18976] 

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, what steps he is taking to reduce 
the number of veterans on Universal Credit. 

Mims Davies: 
I refer the hon. Member to the answer given on 6 February 2024 to PQ11939.

WRITTEN STATEMENTS 

  CULTURE, MEDIA AND SPORT 

  Extension of deadline for representations on anticipated acquisition of Telegraph 

Media Group Limited 

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Lucy Frazer):  

         [HCWS374]        

On 19 March, I confirmed to Parliament that, on the basis of assessments by the 
Competition and Markets Authority and by Ofcom, I am minded to refer the anticipated 
acquisition of Telegraph Media Group Ltd (TMG) by RB Investco Ltd to a Phase 2 
investigation on the grounds of the need for accurate presentation of news and free 
expression of opinion in newspapers. 

I set a deadline of 9am on Monday 25 March 2024 to allow the parties the opportunity to 
make representations to me before I reach a final decision. 

Further to a request from one of the Parties, I have confirmed an extension to that 
deadline, which will now be 9am on Tuesday 2 April 2024. 

  DEFENCE 

  Defence Nuclear Update 

Secretary of Sate for Defence  (Grant Shapps):  

         [HCWS377]        

I am today laying before the House the Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper â â 
Delivering the UKâs Nuclear Deterrent: A National Endeavour â. 

The Command Paper establishes the UKâs nuclear programme as a critical âNational 
Endeavourâ which is vital for our long-term security and prosperity. It details for the first 
time the full breadth of activity required to sustain and modernise the infrastructure and 
activities that deliver the UKâs continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent â a cornerstone of 
national and global security for more than 55 years. 

The Command Paper underlines the importance of our partnerships with the 
communities, businesses and international allies that underpin the deterrent and protect 
our way of life. It articulates how, in response to the evolving security environment, we 
will deliver the capabilities and programmes necessary to maintain and sustain our 
independent nuclear deterrent. It does not represent a change in long-standing nuclear 
doctrine or our ongoing commitment to our disarmament and Non-Proliferation Treaty 
obligations. 

To deliver the required skilled workforce needed to meet our requirement the Civil and 
Defence Nuclear Sectors will invest at least Â£763 million in skills, jobs and education and 
will see 40,000 additional jobs created by 2030. The government and industry have come 
together to launch a Nuclear Skills Plan to create more than 5,000 new apprentices, and 
double the number of graduates over the next 4 years. This plan will also create more 

than 400 specialist PhDs over the same period. This collaborative approach will be 
enshrined in a Nuclear Skills Charter between government and industry. 

In parallel, we are announcing a âPlan for Barrowâ, a new partnership between national 
and local government, BAE Systems and the local community that will oversee 
investment and development in Barrow-in-Furness, the home of submarine building in the 
UK for the past hundred years. This aims to ensure that it is the kind of attractive place to 
live and work that will sustain the skilled workforce required in the decades to come. The 
initial commitment will be for a Barrow Transformation Fund, a ten-year endowment-style 
funding settlement of Â£20 million a year over the next decade providing the multi-year 
certainty and stability needed to support and regenerate the town. This fund will be 
administered through DLUHC, working with the new Barrow Delivery Board and other 
government departments to deliver it. DLUHC will make a further announcement on the 
appointment of the Barrow Delivery Board Chair in due course.

  UK Ocean Leadership 

Minister of State for Development and Africa (Mr Andrew Mitchell):  
[HCWS382]        

My Noble Friend the Minister of State for Climate, Environment and Energy (Lord 
Benyon) has today made the following statement: 

This statement provides an update on UK leadership and engagement on current 
international ocean issues. 

The 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy and 
its 2023 Refresh set out the UKâs vision that by 2030 the ocean will be effectively 
governed, clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse, linking resilient and 
prosperous coastal communities around the world, and supporting sustainable economic 
growth for the UK, the Overseas Territories and the Crown Dependencies. Fundamental 
to this is an absolute commitment to upholding the United Nations Convention on the Law 
of the Sea (UNCLOS) in all its dimensions, as an essential enabler of global prosperity, 
security and a healthy planet. 

The UK played a significant and proactive role in negotiating the landmark Agreement 
under UNCLOS on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity 
of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, known as the BBNJ Agreement. The UK was one 
of the first to sign the Agreement on 20 September 2023 and is keen to see it enter into 
force as quickly as possible. 60 States or regional economic integration organisations 
must become party to the Agreement before it enters into force. To date the Agreement 
has gained 88 signatures and two ratifications. 

The Agreement was laid before Parliament for scrutiny on 16 October 2023. Before the 
UK can ratify international agreements, legislation needs to be in place to ensure that 
new obligations can be complied with. 

         
Work is continuing at pace to prepare UK legislation and the aim is to be able to 
implement and ratify in time for the UN Ocean Conference in June 2025 - an ambitious 
target date shared by other likeminded countries. The UK intends to play an active part in 
the first Conference of the Parties that will meet within the first year after the Agreement 
enters into force, and in the Preparatory Commission to be established by the United 
Nations to prepare for that Conference. The planned timeline for UK legislation to enable 
ratification will ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of states working to effectively 
protect the ocean. 

The provisions in the Agreement on Marine Genetic Resources and the fair and equitable 
sharing of benefits require a clear legislative framework, including substantive provisions 
in primary legislation. They create new obligations for UK business â in particular the 
pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agricultural-technology, cosmetic and chemical sectors - 
and science and research, and thorough engagement with key stakeholders is underway 
to help to ensure that implementation is effective and avoids any unintended 
consequences. 

The UK will continue to be proactive at the international level, in supporting other, 
particularly developing countries, with their implementation and ratification plans. A 
project has recently been agreed with the Commonwealth Secretariat to support smaller 
member countries with their implementation work. The UK is also launching work to 
develop a shortlist of potential Area Based Management Tools that could be proposed 
once the Agreement is in force. 

More broadly, the UK is also fully engaged in negotiations to discuss the development of 
deep sea mining exploitation regulations, currently taking place at the International 
Seabed Authority (ISA) in Kingston, Jamaica from 18-29 March. On 30 October 2023, the 
UK announced that it supports a moratorium on the granting of exploitation licences for 
deep sea mining projects by the ISA and has been driving the need for strong 
enforceable environmental regulations, standards and guidelines to be developed by the 
ISA and put in place before any mining commences. 

As a founding member of the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution, the UK is 
committed to achieving an ambitious treaty by the end of 2024, with the aim of ending 
plastic pollution by 2040, including by restraining and reducing plastic production and 
consumption to sustainable levels, promoting a circular economy for plastic and to 
manage plastic waste in an environmentally sound and safe manner. 

The UK Overseas Territories are home to around 90% of the UKâs biodiversity and host a 
huge range of unique and endangered species, some of which are found nowhere else 
on earth. The UK-funded Blue Belt Programme â the largest of its kind in the world - 
protects 4.4 million square kilometres of ocean around the Overseas Territories, 
underpinning the UKâs commitment to protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030. This flagship 
programme has been central to the UK Governmentâs ambition of leading action to tackle 
the serious global problems of overfishing, species extinction and climate change. 

The UK continues to Chair the Global Ocean Alliance of 77 countries and is ocean 
champion on the International Steering Committee of the High Ambition Coalition for 

Nature & People. Through these positions we are supporting implementation of the 
Global Biodiversity Framework in the ocean, in particular the target to effectively 
conserve and manage at least 30% of the ocean by 2030. The UK is already delivering 
on this target within its own waters. 38% of UK waters are included in a comprehensive 
network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and within the UK Overseas Territories, over 
60% of waters are protected and sustainably managed within the Blue Belt. 

The UK will continue to play a leading role in the many organisations and initiatives that 
work to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and in continuing to 
protect and promote the Blue Belt. 

  HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE 

  Covid-19 Update 

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Minister for Mental Health and Womenâs 
Health Strategy) (Maria Caulfield):  

         [HCWS376]        

On 21 February 2022, the Government published the guidance, COVID-19 Response: 
Living with COVID-19, which set out a plan to live with COVID-19, while protecting people 
at higher risk of serious illness. In March 2023, the Government announced further 
changes towards managing COVID-19 like other respiratory illnesses. New changes from 
1 April 2024 are the next stage in delivering this approach. 

The latest changes are an important milestone in our journey to living with COVID-19. 
After several years of dedicated resources and focus, COVID-19 is now recognised as an 
established and ongoing health issue in the UK and the approach to managing it will now 
be even further aligned with other established respiratory pathogens. Protecting people at 
higher risk remains the Governmentâs priority. 

Vaccines for those at higher risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19 remain central to 
the Governmentâs approach. Last autumnâs COVID-19 vaccination campaign saw over 
70% of all people aged over 65 years living in England receive a COVID-19 booster. In 
care homes, over 80% of residents received a booster, providing vital protection over the 
winter months. Today, due to a combination of immunity acquired from natural infection 
or vaccination, COVID-19 is now a relatively mild disease for the vast majority of people. 

This spring, a COVID-19 vaccine will again be offered to those most at risk of serious 
illness, in line with advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. 
The NHS will also offer more people access to COVID-19 treatments, expanding the 
eligible cohort from the existing 3.9 million people to an additional 1.4 million people at 
highest risk of severe illness. 

The continued effectiveness of vaccines and treatments to protect people at high risk 
means that we can transition to an approach where COVID-19 is managed in line with 
other respiratory illnesses, such as flu. From 1 April 2024, changes will be made to 
COVID-19 testing to align with other respiratory infectious diseases. 

Testing from 1 April 2024 

While the virus causing COVID-19 continues to evolve, new variants have not required a 
return to large-scale public testing. Given the high levels of vaccination among groups at 
higher risk, wider access to treatments and reduced impact of outbreaks, the Government 
is now able to remove some of the highly targeted testing which remains in place from the 
height of the pandemic. 

From 1 April 2024, routine provision of free COVID-19 Lateral Flow Device (LFD) tests for 
the management of outbreaks in higher risk settings will come to an end in England. 
However, free testing to determine the cause of an acute respiratory infection outbreak, 
where deemed appropriate by a local UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) Health 
Protection Team, in higher risk settings will remain to test for a wide range of respiratory 
viruses. 

Routine asymptomatic COVID-19 LFD testing on discharge from hospital into care or 
hospice settings will also end to align with the approach for other respiratory illnesses, 
though NHS Trusts will have local discretion to re-introduce this or other forms of testing 
as clinically appropriate following risk assessment, involving Local Authority Public Health 
Teams, UKHSA Health Protection Teams and care providers as necessary in decision 
making. 

Acute health providers should have trusted processes in place with local care home and 
hospice providers to facilitate safe discharges, as set out in the hospital discharge and 
community support guidance. Together with the care home or hospice, hospitals should 
assess the risk in the period before planned discharge, seeking advice on proposed 
changes to testing arrangements from Local Authority public Health Teams or UKHSA 
Health Protection Teams if needed. 

Care providers and hospices will also continue to have the ability to discuss and raise any 
concerns about discharge arrangements through existing local mechanisms. Where a 
care provider or hospice is providing services commissioned by a local authority or the 
NHS and has concerns about a planned discharge that cannot be resolved with the acute 
hospital provider, this includes the ability to contact the relevant commissioner. 

Limited testing, including symptomatic testing of staff working on inpatient wards 
focussed on treating profoundly immunocompromised individuals, will continue in line 
with locally derived protocols to protect those most at risk. Symptomatic testing of patient-
facing hospice staff who work closely with people who are at high risk from severe 
outcomes if suffering from COVID-19 will also continue as outlined in guidance, in line 
with similar NHS settings. 

The cohort of people eligible for COVID-19 treatments can continue to access free 
COVID-19 LFDs from their local pharmacy. These people, who are at highest risk of 
becoming seriously ill, are encouraged to test to gain timely access to treatments. A full 
list of those who are eligible, and information on how to access tests, is available on the 
NHS website. 

Guidance on a range of infection prevention and control measures in Adult Social Care 
has now been combined with acute respiratory infection guidance and has been updated 
to reflect these changes. This guidance, as well as guidance for hospices and other non-

clinical settings, has been updated to reflect the latest evidence and expert consensus. It 
is technical guidance to support settings in operationalising the changes to the services 
they are directly responsible for from 1 April 2024. 

Guidance published on 1 April 2022 for individuals in the community with symptoms of 
COVID-19 or respiratory illness continues to set out the actions we can all take to help 
reduce the risk of catching COVID-19 and passing it on to others. 

The future approach to pandemic preparedness  

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the public health and economic risks posed by 
pandemics. The Government is continuing to work closely with partners to reduce the 
impact of a future pandemic. Together, UKHSA and the Department of Health and Social 
Care are developing plans to prevent and/or respond efficiently and effectively in the 
event of a pandemic. 

These plans will build on learning from COVID-19, and the findings of the COVID-19 
Inquiry, once published. The exact nature of a future pandemic may vary, and so 
preparedness is considering all modes of transmission and tackling âDisease Xâ in 
readiness for unknown future threats. 

The Government has already taken steps to prepare and develop capacity to respond, 
including through the Moderna-UK Strategic Partnership and the Vaccines Development 
and Evaluation Centre. Through UKHSA, we retain strong surveillance systems, world-
leading genomic sequencing capabilities, and stronger baseline data and analysis 
functions that will help detect and characterise pandemic threats. 

  HOME OFFICE 

  Home Office Update 

The Secretary of State for the Home Department (James Cleverly):          [HCWS378]        

On 29 February 2024, a report on Part 1 of the independent Angiolini Inquiry was 
published. The Inquiry was established following the horrific murder of Sarah Everard in 
March 2021 by then-serving Metropolitan Police Service officer Wayne Couzens. 

On the same day, I gave a statement to the House to acknowledge the Inquiryâs findings. 

Part 1 examined the previous career and conduct of Couzens and found a number of red 
flags and missed opportunities. Based on these findings, the Chair made a total of 16 
recommendations, summarily to improve the policing response to sexual offences, such 
as indecent exposure, to strengthen police recruitment and vetting practices, and to 
address toxic police cultures. 

Today I can confirm acceptance of all three of the recommendations made to the 
Government, which the Home Office will now work to deliver at pace. These 
recommendations are that the Home Office, in collaboration with partners, should 
conduct a fundamental review of the way masturbatory indecent exposure is treated 
within the criminal justice system; commission research to establish if there is an 

evidence-based link between masturbatory indecent exposure and subsequent offending; 
and launch a campaign to raise awareness that indecent exposure and sending 
unsolicited photographs of genitals amounts to criminality and boost victimsâ confidence 
to report such crimes. 

Further recommendations on police vetting, recruitment and culture were made directly to 
police forces, the National Police Chiefsâ Council and College of Policing, who have also 
today accepted all recommendations made to policing. I will work closely with policing to 
ensure that they drive this work forward promptly. 

Tackling violence against women and girls is one of my top priorities. I am confident that 
our strong partnership and shared commitment with the National Police Chiefsâ Council 
and College of Policing will lead to concerted, swift action. 

I will provide a further update to Parliament on progress made in implementing the 
recommendations before Summer recess. 

I am grateful to Lady Elish and her team for their crucial and continued work, which will 
ensure that policing continues to make improvements necessary to rebuild the confidence 
of everyone they serve. I await the Inquiryâs further findings from Part 2, which is 
examining broader national issues such as vetting, recruitment and culture, as well as the 
safety of women in public spaces. 

  Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (1 December 2023 to 29 February 

2024) 

The Minister of State for Security (Tom Tugendhat):  

         [HCWS375]        

Section 19(1) of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) Act 2011 
(the Act) requires the Secretary of State to report to Parliament as soon as reasonably 
practicable after the end of every relevant three-month period on the exercise of their 
TPIM powers under the Act during that period. 

The level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on 
operational advice.

  LEVELLING UP, HOUSING AND COMMUNITIES 

  Community Ownership Fund Round 3 Window 3 Outcome 

Minister for Levelling Up (Jacob Young):  

         [HCWS379]        

I am delighted to announce the outcome of Round 3 Window 3 of the Â£150 million 
Community Ownership Fund, which will see over Â£33.5 million awarded to 83 projects 
across the United Kingdom. This additional funding takes our funding total to around 
Â£103.1 million for 333 projects. 

This investment will ensure that important parts of our social fabric, such as pubs, sports 
clubs, theatres, and post office buildings, can continue to play a central role in towns and 
villages across the UK. 

The Community Ownership Fund is helping to reduce geographical disparities across the 
United Kingdom. To this end, the funding provided in Round 3 Window 3 will see over 
Â£3.8 million awarded to projects in Scotland, over Â£3.1 million to Wales and over Â£2.8 
million to Northern Ireland. This, so far, brings the total funding awarded across Scotland, 
Wales, and Northern Ireland to over Â£32.1 million collectively, with Scotland, Wales and 
Northern Ireland having exceeded their minimum allocation across the duration of the 
Fund. 

The funding provided in Round 3 Window 3 will also see over Â£23.6 million awarded to 
projects in England. This brings the total funding awarded across English regions to over 
Â£70.9 million collectively. 

 
The Community Fund is already supporting 250 projects across the UK such as Keighley 
& Worth Valley Railwayâs historic railway bridge, in Bradford, England; the Vale of Aeron 
pub, a favourite haunt of the poet Dylan Thomas in Ceredigion, Wales; the Kingâs Theatre 
in Edinburgh, one of Scotlandâs most historic and significant theatres; and Glens Digital 
Hub in Causeway Coast and Glens, Northern Ireland, which has been transformed into a 
vibrant community digital hub. These projects are making a genuine difference to their 
communities. 

With the additional investment awarded in this bidding window, I am delighted to be 
supporting many more small but mighty local assets across the United Kingdom, levelling 
up the places we love and cherish. 

Round 4 will be the final round of the Community Ownership Fund. Recognising that 
there is limited funding available yet to be allocated to meet the high demand we have 
experienced, we will seek to hold two final bidding windows to allocate this funding. 
Round 4 Window 1 will open today (25 March 2024) and close on 10 April 2024. 
Voluntary and community organisations, and parish, town and community councils can 
apply for up to Â£2 million in capital funding, to rescue treasured local institutions. 

  TRANSPORT 

  Rail Update 

Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Mark Harper):  

         [HCWS380]        

On 4 October 2023 the Government announced Network North - a new, Â£36 billion plan 
to improve our countryâs transport. In addition to this, we confirmed Â£12bn of investment 
to enable Northern Powerhouse Rail to proceed in line with previous plans to better 
connect Liverpool and Manchester. As promised in the Network North announcement, the 
Rail Minister and I have engaged extensively with local leaders to ensure that this plan 
was right for them and to understand whether they wished to suggest alternative ways to 
achieve the objectives with that funding. 

We have heard from these stakeholders in favour of continuing to serve Warrington Bank 
Quay and Manchester Airport and using broadly the current route towards Manchester as 
part of our Northern Powerhouse Rail plans. There is also interest from local leaders in 
exploring further options for station design at Manchester Piccadilly and for routings into 
Liverpool including station options. Government remains open to considering these 
issues, subject, as usual, to affordability within the funding envelope, standard business 
case approvals, and demonstrating value for taxpayersâ money. I look forward to 
continuing discussions on these points. 

Recognising the consensus reached, I am today confirming that this will represent the 
basis for the next stage of development. As with any major scheme, delivery will be 
subject to securing consents and the approval of future business cases. Further, while 
the consensus reached will form the primary option that we work from, Government will 
continue to assess alternatives which meet the objectives of NPR, in line with standard 
requirements for business case approvals. Any scheme must be affordable and 

demonstrate value for money for the taxpayer, while seeking to support the rail capacity 
needs of central Manchester and deliver faster journey times and better connectivity 
across the Pennines. 

On this basis, I will be continuing to promote the High Speed Rail (Crewe-Manchester) 
Bill as the fastest possible means of consenting the first part of that route into 
Manchester. Subject to the will of the House, the Government will seek to adapt the Bill to 
deliver Northern Powerhouse Rail only, removing scope south of the Parish of Millington 
and Rostherne, which was included only for HS2. The adaptation of the Bill from HS2 to 
NPR and removal of HS2 scope from the Bill would prompt a further environmental 
assessment to be produced which would include revised construction impacts with a view 
to reducing impacts where possible. 

In line with these plans HS2 Phase 2b safeguarding will be amended by summer 2024, to 
allow for any safeguarding needed for Northern Powerhouse Rail. 

  WORK AND PENSIONS 

  Pensions Dashboard Update 

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Pensions (Paul Maynard):  
[HCWS381]        

The success of automatic enrolment has led to record numbers of people saving for 
retirement. Pensions dashboards will allow individuals to view information about their 
pensions, including their State Pension, for free, in one place online. This will help 
individualsâ awareness and understanding of their pension information and estimated 
income in retirement, building a greater sense of individual control and ownership. 

Since the reset was initiated last year, the Pensions Dashboards Programme has made 
significant progress building and testing the system which will enable pensions 
dashboards to work. Subject to satisfactory testing, the programme plans to begin the 
process of connecting the organisations building a direct connection, including DWP 
State Pension, from August 2024. Connection testing will then continue to ensure 
readiness to support wider industry connection from early 2025. 

The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will today publish guidance setting out a 
staged timetable for connection. This will help smooth the process of connecting the 
approximately 3,000 pension schemes and providers in scope by the connection deadline 
of 31 October 2026. The timetable prioritises connection of the largest pension schemes 
and providers, so that crucial user testing can quickly take place at scale, with the first 
cohort expected to have completed connection by the end of April 2025. Whilst the 
timetable is not mandatory, it is a legal requirement that trustees or managers of 
occupational pension schemes and providers of personal and stakeholder pensions have 
regard to this guidance. 

The Government is absolutely committed to delivering pensions dashboards safely and 
securely to the public at the earliest opportunity. The publication of the connection 
timetable marks a significant milestone towards launching pensions dashboards, and 

         
takes us closer to introducing a service that has the potential to transform how individuals 
plan for retirement.
