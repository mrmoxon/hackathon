Visas: Skilled Workers
Deidre Brock: 1938:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to the Migration
Advisory Committee's Rapid review of the Immigration Salary List, published on 23
February 2024, for what reason his Department has not implemented the
‘recommendation on the use of the Immigration Salary List beyond the skilled worker
route for asylum seekers.
‘Tom Pursglove:
Replacing the Shortage Occupation List with the new Immigration Salary List will
‘maintain the important principles that underpin our approach to permission to work
‘and is inline with wider changes to the Immigration Rules.
Unrestricted access to employment could act as an incentive for more migrants to
‘choose to come here illegally, with many making dangerous journeys across the
‘Channel and supporting the business model of evil people smugglers, rather than
‘claim asylum in the first safe country they reach.

‘The Goverment considers it important to distinguish between those who need
protection and those seeking to work here who can apply for a work visa under the
Immigration Rules. Aligning asylum seekers’ permission to work with the Skilled

‘Worker route could undermine the legal routes for those seeking to workin the UK.
