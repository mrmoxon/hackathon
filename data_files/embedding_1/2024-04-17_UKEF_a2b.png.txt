To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, what the benefits to the UK are of,
the funding committed to the Ineos energy investment in Belgium.

Greg Hands:

UK Export Finance's (UKEF's) support for the Ineos Project One plant secures new
export opportunities for the UK by enabling an overseas buyer to finance the
purchase of goods, services and/or intangibles from UK suppliers.

As the UK's export credit agency, UKEF's mission is to advance prosperity by
ensuring no viable UK export fails for lack of finance or insurance, doing that
sustainably and at no net cost to the taxpayer.
