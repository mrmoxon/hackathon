Asylum: Housing
Lloyd Russell-Moyle: [19922]
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what assessment he has made
of whether private providers responsible for running asylum accommodation are meeting
their contractual requirements.
Tom Pursglove:
The Asylum Accommodation and Support Services Contracts (AASC) Statement of
Requirements below gives a detailed breakdown of all of the services to be
undertaken by our accommodation providers and to the standards we expect:

AASC - Schedule 2 - Statement of Requirements.pdf (parliament.uk).

Home Office accommodation providers are required to visit each property at least
â€˜monthly, and assurance that contractual requirements are met is tested by the Home
Office Contract Assurance Team, which inspects properties and undertakes other
assurance activities on an intelligence-led basis. Formal governance mechanisms are
in place, to oversee performance and delivery against contractual requirements.
