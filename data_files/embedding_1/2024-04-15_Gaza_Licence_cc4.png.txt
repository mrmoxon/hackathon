Zarah Sultana: [16032]

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, with reference to the press release
entitled Arms exports to Israel must stop immediately: UN experts, published by the
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 23r February 2024, if she will
take steps to cease the transfer of (a) weapons and (b) ammunition to Israel that would
be used in Gaza.

Greg Hands:

All export licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against the
UK's Strategic Export Licensing Criteria.

The Export Control Joint Unit will not issue an export licence to any destination where
to do so would be inconsistent with the Criteria, including where there is a clear risk
that the items might be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of International
Humanitarian Law.

The Government is monitoring the situation in Israel and Gaza very closely and will
take any action the Government considers appropriate as the situation develops. All
extant licences are kept under careful review and we are able to amend, suspend or
revoke licences as circumstances require.
