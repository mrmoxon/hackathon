(On 31 March 2021, the previous Government published its policy on support forthe fossil
‘uel sector overseas [1] As part ofthis, the Government set out that it would withdraw all
‘new financial and promotional suppor for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas, with very
limited exemptions.
‘Since the introduction ofthis policy, the Government can confirm that no such overseas
{fossil fuel projects have recelved financial funding or support from UK Export Finance
(UKEF); nor have they received any government investment. However, | regret to inform
‘the House that we have recently discovered that a limited numberof projects did receive
‘other support that contravened this policy in the period April 2021 — October 2023,
‘Suppor typically facussed on market entry and trade promotion advice.

During this period, 134 projets worth £747 milion were recorded as having been
supported by departmental ofcials in some capacity. These 134 project ae a small
propotion (1.00%) ofthe 13,457 projects, and the £0.747bilion of export wins are
Similarly a small proportion (1.35%) of the total valve of £55.942bilon of exports in these
years.

None of these projects were subject othe approval of Government Ministers and
Ministers were not made aware of these projects unt the discrepancies were ciscovered
recent by ofcials. The projects were however included inthe Government's ‘Export
‘Wins’ data between 2021-2023,

My department has taken steps to rectify and remedy the ise. We have putin place
adsitonal measures, checks and reporting to ensure al staff understand and adhere to
the polcy and can demonstrat clearty that no suppor is being given that contravenes
te policy.

‘We have also wnten to colleagues who were inadvertently given incorec information.
