[Department for Business and Trade: Equality
O'Brien: 15473}
To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, how many staff in their Department
have job titles that include the words (a) equality, (b) diversity, (c) inclusion, (d) gender,
(e) LGBT and (f) race.
Greg Hands:
Nine DBT staff members have the words equality and/or gender in their job titles.
These roles are all externally facing roles, responsible for negotiating provisions and
chapters within bilateral and multilateral contexts. There are no DBT staff members
with diversity; inclusion; LGBT; or race in their job title.
The Government is auditing the cost-effectiveness of all activities that support the
â€˜equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) of the workforce, through the review of EDI
spending announced last June. As stated in the Autumn Statement by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, the Minister for Cabinet Office will be outlining the final proposals in
response to the review in due course.
