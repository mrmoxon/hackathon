British National (Overseas): Airports

Daisy Cooper: 19475)

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will set a target date for

British National (Overseas) passport holders to be able to use eGates at the UK border.
Tom Pursglove:
The Government regularly reviews eGate eligibility for all nationals arriving in the UK,
including British National (Overseas) passport holders.
In the New Plan for Immigration, the Government set out our ambition to digitise the
border. To deliver this we aim to increase the use of eGates at the border by those
currently eligible and investigate options to extend eGate eligibility to those unable to
use them. Any shorter-term changes need to be balanced against the impact these
have on delivering the longer-term ambition.
