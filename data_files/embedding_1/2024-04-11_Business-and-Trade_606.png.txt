Asylum: Age Assurance

Sir John Hayes: [19252]
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, how many and what proportion
of young asylum seekers have been identified as being over the age of 18 following (a)
age verification and (b) identity checks in each of the last five years.
Tom Pursglove:
The Home Office publishes data on asylum in the ‘immigration System Statistics
Quarterly Release’. Data on asylum applications by age is published in table
Asy_DO1 of the ‘Asylum applications, decisions and resettlement detailed datasets’,
The latest data relates to 2023.
Data on age disputes is published in table Asy_DOS of the ‘Age disputes detailed
dataset’. The latest data relates to the year ending September 2023.

Information on how to use these datasets can be found in the ‘Notes’ page of each
workbook. Additionally, the Home Office publishes a high-level overview of the data
in the ‘summary tables’. The ‘contents’ sheet contains an overview of all available
data on asylum applications by age and age disputes.

Please note that an age dispute could, for example, be resolved following: a Merton
compliant age assessment; receipt of credible and clear documentary evidence of
‘age; a judicial finding on age; following a determination by two Home Office officers
that the person's physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggests they
are significantly over the age of 18; or, where the reasons for raising an age dispute
no longer apply.
