To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, with reference to paragraphs 28
and 29 of the summary grounds of the Secretary of State provided in the High Court case
between the King (on the application of Al-Haq) v the Secretary of State for Business and
Trade, AC-2023-LON-003634, whether any of the arms export licences identified in the
Change in Circumstances review have been revoked since January 2024.

Greg Hands:
The Government is monitoring the situation in Israel and Gaza very closely.

The Government can and does respond quickly and flexibly to changing international
circumstances. All licences are kept under careful and continual review and are able
to be amended, suspended, refused or revoked as circumstances require.

HM Government publishes data on export licensing decisions on a quarterly basis in
the Official Statistics, including data on outcome, end user destination, overall value,
type (e.g. military, other) and a summary of the items covered by these licences. This
data is available at: https:/mww.gov.uk/quidance/strategic-export-controls-licensing-
