1 Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-pacific Partnership
David Linden: [19156
To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, if she will have discussions with
the Leader of the House on allocating time for debate on a substantive motion relating to
the UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership ahead of the conclusion of the statutory 21 sitting day period for which the
treaty is laid before Parliament.

Greg Hands:

The Government is committed to effective scrutiny of its trade agenda and has put i
place a comprehensive framework for scrutiny of free trade agreements (FTAs). This
includes a commitment to seek to hold a general debate on a new FTA where one is
requested by the relevant Select Committee, subject to parliamentary time being
available.

The scheduling of parliamentary business is not a matter for the Department for
Business and Trade.
