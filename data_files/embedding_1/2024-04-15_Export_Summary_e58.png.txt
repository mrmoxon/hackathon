To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, what assessment she has made of
the impact of the UK's exit from the EU on the volume of goods imports and exports
between 2018 and 2023; and what steps she is taking to increase goods imports and
exports.
Greg Hands:
We are leading a whole of Government effort to tackle trade barriers. In the 2022-23
financial year alone, the Department resolved 178 trade barriers.
Total UK goods trade in 2023 was worth £974. billion - a 15% increase compared to
2018 in current prices.
We continue to help businesses trade globally with a wealth of support options on
great. gov.uk, including the Export Academy, Export Champions, our International
Markets network and UK Export Finance.
The Department has around 300 staff across our network of Embassies and High
‘Commissions in Europe to resolve market access barriers faced by businesses,
promote exports and encourage investments.
