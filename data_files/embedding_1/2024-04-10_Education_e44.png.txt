| Asylum: Employment
Deidre Brock: [19083]

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, if he will make an assessment of
the potential impact of replacing the Shortage Occupation List with the Immigration Salary
List on employment opportunities for asylum seekers who are eligible to work.
Tom Pursglove:
The Home Secretary commissioned the independent Migration Advisory Committee
(MAC) to carry out a rapid review of the new Immigration Salary List (ISL) ahead of
the Spring Immigration Rules. Appendix Immigration Salary List can be found in the
Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules: HC 590, published on 14 March
2024. We will keep the list under review and the MAC will carry out a fuller review
later in the year.

Replacing the new ISL will maintain the important principles that underpin our
approach to permission to work by an individual's asylum claim still being outstanding
for 12 months or more, through no fault of their own. This includes the need to avoid
creating perverse incentives for people to make dangerous journeys to the UK and to.
not undercut the resident labour market.
