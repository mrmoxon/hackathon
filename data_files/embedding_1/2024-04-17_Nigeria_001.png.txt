Caroline Lucas: 18879)

To ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, pursuant to the Answer of 29
February 2024 to Question 15265 on Shell: Nigeria, whether her Department has raised
the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project during trade negotiations with Nigeria.

Greg Hands:

The Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project was not part of the discussions with
the Federal Government of Nigeria, when agreeing the UK-Nigeria Enhanced Trade
and Investment Partnership (ETIP). The ETIP is a forward-looking and non-legally
binding arrangement, which aims to cover issues both countries wish to work on, to
resolve non-tariff market access barriers, and to boost mutual trade and investment.

However, the UK encourages a coordinated effort between the Nigerian Government,
oil and gas companies, and communities to bring an end to all forms of oil
contamination in Nigeria.
